**Controllers with Auth::user() usage:**
- `WorkspaceController.php` (lines 47, 63, 87, 110, 164)
- Several other controllers need similar fixes

**Impact:** This causes "Call to a member function workspaces() on null" errors
**Solution:** Replace `Auth::user()` with `$request->user()` throughout all controllers
