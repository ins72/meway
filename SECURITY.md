## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### General Security Principles

#### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults
- Least privilege principle
- Regular security audits

#### Secure Development Lifecycle
- Security requirements gathering
- Threat modeling
- Secure code review
- Security testing
- Deployment security

### Password Security

#### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No common passwords
- Regular password changes recommended

#### Password Storage
- bcrypt hashing with salt
- Minimum 12 rounds
- No plain text storage
- Secure password reset process

### Session Management

#### Session Security
- Secure session tokens
- Session timeout after inactivity
- Session invalidation on logout
- Protection against session fixation

#### Cookie Security
```php
'secure' => true,
'httponly' => true,
'same_site' => 'strict',
```

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

#### TOTP Implementation
- Time-based One-Time Passwords
- 30-second token validity
- Backup codes for recovery
- Secure QR code generation

#### OAuth 2.0 Integration
- Google OAuth 2.0
- Facebook OAuth 2.0
- Apple Sign-In
- Secure token handling

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

#### Permission System
```php
// Example permission check
if (auth()->user()->can('create-posts')) {
    // User can create posts
}
```

#### Role Hierarchy
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Admin**: Workspace administration
- **Manager**: Team management
- **User**: Standard features
- **Guest**: Limited access

### API Security

#### Token-Based Authentication
- Laravel Sanctum implementation
- Token expiration
- Token revocation
- Rate limiting

#### API Rate Limiting
```php
// Rate limiting example
Route::middleware('throttle:60,1')->group(function () {
    // API routes
});
```

## üíª Code Security

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
```php
// Example input validation
$validator = Validator::make($request->all(), [
    'email' => 'required|email|max:255',
    'password' => 'required|min:8|max:128',
]);

if ($validator->fails()) {
    return response()->json(['errors' => $validator->errors()], 422);
}
```

#### Output Encoding
```php
// Escape output
echo htmlspecialchars($userInput, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');

// Blade template (automatic escaping)
{{ $userInput }}
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention
```php
// Use parameterized queries
$users = DB::select('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?', [$email]);

// Eloquent ORM (automatic protection)
User::where('email', $email)->first();
```

### Vulnerability Prevention

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy
- HttpOnly cookies

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
