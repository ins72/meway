# Mewayz Platform - Action Plan & Next Steps (2025)

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUE (Must Fix First)

**1. Authentication Fix - Auth::user() vs $request->user()**

**Impact:** This is blocking proper authentication in several controllers
**Files to Fix:**
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/WorkspaceController.php`
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/SocialMediaController.php` 
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/CrmController.php`
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/EmailMarketingController.php`
- `/app/Http/Controllers/Api/AnalyticsController.php`

**Solution Pattern:**
```php
// Replace this:
if ($workspace->user_id !== auth()->id()) {
    // or
if ($workspace->user_id !== Auth::user()->id) {

// With this:
if ($workspace->user_id !== $request->user()->id) {
```

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
