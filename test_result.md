    message: "Backend API testing completed. Authentication system is fully functional. Major issues found: 1) Missing database tables (organization table for workspaces), 2) Missing model classes (SocialMediaAccount, SocialMediaPost), 3) Database schema mismatches (bio_sites table missing 'slug' column). The API controllers are well-implemented but require proper database schema and model classes to function correctly."
