    message: "COMPREHENSIVE ADMIN PLAN MANAGEMENT AUDIT COMPLETED - SIGNIFICANT GAPS IDENTIFIED: Conducted thorough audit of admin plan management operations to identify missing functionality for complete operational control. AUDIT RESULTS: 21 features audited - 7 existing (33%), 13 missing (62%), 1 partial (5%). CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1 critical gap and 9 high-priority gaps identified. TOP MISSING FEATURES: 1) Plan change impact management for existing subscriptions (CRITICAL), 2) Admin workspace subscription override system, 3) Advanced subscription search/filter capabilities, 4) Manual discount and comp account management, 5) Plan change notification system, 6) Churn analysis and revenue forecasting reports. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP: Phase 1 (Critical - 4-6 weeks): Plan change impact analysis, Plan deprecation workflow. Phase 2 (High Priority - 8-12 weeks): 14 features including admin workspace management endpoints, subscription lifecycle tools, reporting dashboards. Phase 3 (Medium - 4-6 weeks): 3 operational enhancement tools. TOTAL ESTIMATED EFFORT: 16-24 weeks for complete admin operational control.
