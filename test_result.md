    message: "CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE: PHP 8.2 runtime is not installed in the testing environment. Error: '/usr/bin/php8.2: not found'. This prevents the Laravel server from starting on port 8001, making all backend API testing impossible. The comprehensive audit reports show that most features (85% complete) were working in previous tests when PHP was available. The application architecture is sound with proper Laravel implementation, but requires PHP runtime to function."
  
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "TESTING ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS: Found Python server on port 8010 (FastAPI) but no Laravel server. The application is a Laravel 10 project with comprehensive API routes defined in routes/api.php covering all major features. Database configuration shows MariaDB setup. All controller files exist and previous audits confirm functionality when server was operational."
  
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should focus on resolving the PHP runtime installation issue before attempting further backend development. Once PHP 8.2 is available, the Laravel server should start successfully on port 8001 and all API endpoints should be testable. The codebase appears complete and functional based on file analysis and previous audit reports."
