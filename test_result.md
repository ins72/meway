        comment: "❌ CRITICAL DATA MODEL MISMATCH: Instagram Management system completely non-functional due to fundamental architecture issue. Root cause: InstagramManagementController expects Workspace model with is_primary field, but actual system uses Organization model without this field. All 8 Instagram API endpoints fail with 'Workspace not found' error. Specific issues: 1) User->workspaces() relationship returns Workspace model, 2) WorkspaceController uses Organization model, 3) Instagram controller queries $user->workspaces()->where('is_primary', true) but Organization model has no is_primary field, 4) Database contains organizations table but Instagram system expects workspaces table. This is a fundamental design inconsistency that prevents the entire Instagram Management system from functioning. Requires: 1) Align data models (use either Workspace or Organization consistently), 2) Add is_primary field to chosen model, 3) Update all controllers to use same model, 4) Ensure proper workspace/organization creation flow. Authentication works (✅), but workspace resolution fails completely (❌). All 8 endpoints affected: GET /accounts, POST /accounts, GET /posts, POST /posts, PUT /posts/{id}, DELETE /posts/{id}, GET /hashtag-research, GET /analytics."
