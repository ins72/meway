## 🎯 IDENTIFIED ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### **SERVICE METHOD MAPPING ISSUES (30 endpoints)**
**Issue**: API routes calling service methods with different names than what exists in service files.

**Examples**:
- API calls `get_cx_dashboard()` but service has `get_cx_analytics_dashboard()`
- API calls `get_journey_mapping()` but service has `get_customer_journey_analytics()`
- API calls `collect_feedback()` but service has `get_feedback_surveys()`

**Solution**: Systematic API-Service method name alignment needed.

### **SYNTAX ERRORS IN SERVICE FILES**
**Issue**: Some service files have syntax errors preventing backend startup.

**Fixed**:
- ✅ webhook_service.py - Indentation error fixed
- ✅ content_creation_service.py - Await outside async function fixed

**Remaining**: Similar issues likely exist in other service files.

### **MAIN.PY ACCESS VERIFICATION**
**Issue**: Main.py missing imports for newly created services.
**Solution**: ✅ COMPLETED - Added 60 missing imports
