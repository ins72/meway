The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz application from MVP to a more stable, documented state. Initial challenges included persistent frontend Flutter serving and PWA issues, which pivoted the immediate task to comprehensive documentation generation. The engineer systematically updated branding from Zeph to Mewayz and Mewayz Technologies Inc. across all documentation and relevant code files. A detailed code review ensued, resolving numerous TODOs and improving code quality in both Laravel backend (CRM, E-commerce, Workspace controllers) and Flutter frontend (API services, authentication flow, logging). A critical FastAPI static file serving issue was identified and meticulously fixed. Subsequently, upon user clarification, the FastAPI backend was entirely removed, streamlining the architecture to a Laravel-only backend directly serving all content. Finally, a massive, enterprise-grade product specification was provided by the user. The engineer immediately assessed this, identified currently implemented features, and proposed a comprehensive 5-phase roadmap for future development, concluding by requesting user prioritization.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native, all-in-one business platform, consolidating social media management, digital commerce, education, CRM, marketing automation, website building, booking, template marketplaces, escrow, and financial management. Its architecture relies on a Laravel 10+ backend with MySQL 8.0+ and Flutter 3.x for mobile/desktop. Key non-functional requirements include high performance (<200ms API, <3s page loads, 10,000+ concurrent users, 99.9% uptime) and stringent security (AES-256, TLS 1.3, SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, RBAC). Core implemented features include PWA architecture, a professional authentication system (OAuth 2.0, SSO, 2FA, biometrics), multi-workspace management, and foundational social media, CRM, E-commerce, and Link in Bio functionalities. The user explicitly requested professional, in-depth documentation, consistent branding (Mewayz by Mewayz Technologies Inc., Seamless philosophy), and resolution of all frontend and backend errors, with future enhancements guided by the detailed 15-section product specification.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer completed a significant phase of work, shifting the Mewayz platform towards a production-ready state and then receiving a full product vision.

Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent frontend PWA/routing issues, which led to an extensive task of generating comprehensive documentation as explicitly requested by the user. This involved:
1.  **Comprehensive Branding Update**: All documentation and relevant code files (e.g., , SEO files) were updated to consistently use Mewayz as the product name, Mewayz Technologies Inc. as the company, and Seamless as the core philosophy. Domain references were safely updated to  in documentation and comments. A  was generated.
2.  **Platform Review & Fixes**: A meticulous file-by-file review was conducted. All  items and incomplete implementations in backend Laravel API controllers (CRM, E-commerce, Workspace, Social Media) were addressed. Critical Flutter frontend issues were resolved, including removing hardcoded API URLs, implementing file uploads, fixing authentication flow on the splash screen, and replacing  statements with a new professional  utility.
3.  **FastAPI Removal and Laravel Direct Serving**: A critical discovery was the redundancy of the FastAPI proxy. The FastAPI backend ( directory and its supervisor configuration) was completely removed. Laravel was then configured to directly serve all backend logic, static files, and API routes on port 8001, simplifying the architecture and improving performance. All related documentation was updated to reflect this new Laravel-only structure, and an  was created.
4.  **Comprehensive Documentation Suite**: Following these fixes, a full suite of professional documentation was created and updated, including , , , , , , , and , along with enhancements to existing , , and .

The most recent immediate work involves the user providing a new, extremely detailed Mewayz - Complete All-in-One Business Platform specification (Chat Message 380). The AI engineer's current task has pivoted to analyzing this extensive specification, assessing the current implementation against it, and proposing a multi-phase roadmap for future development (Chat Message 381), explicitly asking the user to prioritize which phase or features to work on next.
