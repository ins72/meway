The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Laravel 11 application, addressing a critical authentication flaw by implementing  middleware. The user transitioned frontend development from React to Laravel Blade, emphasizing a 100% feature completion goal with configurations managed via an admin dashboard. The core task at hand is a comprehensive codebase audit, explicitly requested by the user, covering documentation, Blade files, routes, and controllers. The AI engineer systematically processed , , and proceeded to read numerous Blade files,  routes, and started with . A known issue requiring attention is the incorrect use of  instead of  in controllers. The engineer was in the process of completing the audit before this handover.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution, integrating social media, digital commerce, education, CRM, and marketing. It features a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and tiered subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise). Authentication will include email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, and future biometric options. Core functionalities encompass Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, and Analytics, all centrally managed via an Admin Dashboard. The platform must be mobile-optimized (PWA with Flutter web loader), built on Laravel with MySQL (MariaDB), and persist all data. Crucially, all environment variables, API keys, and database configurations must be visually managed through the admin dashboard, targeting 100% feature completion.

<code_architecture>
The codebase is a Laravel 11 application with a modular structure:

-   : Houses API endpoints for core features like Escrow, Advanced Booking, Link Shortener, Referral, and Template Marketplace, implementing business logic.
-   : A custom middleware crucial for resolving authentication issues, replacing default  for secure API access.
-   : Eloquent models mapping to database tables for new features like Escrow, Booking, Link Shortener, Referral, and Template Marketplace.
-   : Defines the database schema, including migrations for various features and updates to  and  tables.
-   : Frontend UI Blade files.  and  are vital for workspace setup and the main dashboard. During the audit, , , , , , , , and  were read.
-    and : Define application routes.  includes new API controller routes with , and  handles web-based routes.  was read during the audit.

<current_work>
The Laravel 11 application is established with a MariaDB backend and initial Blade-based UI. A significant authentication issue was resolved by replacing  with  middleware across API routes. The Escrow and Advanced Booking systems are backend-complete, including new models, migrations, and foreign key corrections.

The previous AI engineer focused on filling missing features and progressing towards 100% completion. Backend infrastructure for the Multi-workspace System was built (setup, features, goals, subscription plans, team invitations), with corresponding migrations and a . Frontend Blade views (, ) and web routes for this system were created, and database issues for  table were fixed.

Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace features were scaffolded on the backend, with controllers, models, migrations, and API routes added. The immediate and current task, following explicit user request, is a comprehensive audit of the entire codebase. The AI engineer has successfully read  and . All Blade files in  have been systematically audited, including , , , , , , , and . Route auditing has started with  and controller auditing has begun with . A known outstanding issue is the incorrect use of  instead of  in backend controllers.
