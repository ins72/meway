The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the Mewayz platform from an MVP by integrating external APIs and eliminating mock data, focusing initially on core features, security, and performance. Despite initial claims of compliance, an audit revealed significant gaps. A comprehensive, multi-phase plan was established and approved, prioritizing real data integration. The engineer acquired necessary API keys and initiated systematic implementation. Key progress includes integrating real social media lead generation (X/TikTok), AI automation, and email marketing. Backend testing confirmed these integrations. After a user-requested audit, the engineer identified and documented missing features. Subsequently, the Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard and Link in Bio Builder were fully implemented with real data and comprehensive CRUD functionality, passing their respective tests. The current directive is to continue implementing remaining features without intermediate testing. The engineer is now working on the E-commerce System.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is a mobile-first PWA, built on FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, consolidating 15+ business tools into an AI-powered ecosystem. It requires multi-workspace support with RBAC, user invitations, multi-factor authentication (Google, Apple, Email, Stripe), comprehensive social media management (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn with lead generation, advanced filtering, and CSV export), Link in Bio (drag-and-drop, templates, custom domains), CRM/Email Marketing (lead scoring, automated workflows, bulk account creation), Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics with gamification, Course & Community (Skool-like), Template Marketplace (monetization, creation), and an AI/Automation suite with a token economy, all accessible via an Admin Dashboard. Critical mandates include exclusive MongoDB usage (despite mention of MySQL for some tracking), mobile optimization, dark theme, and strict avoidance of hardcoded or mock data, ensuring all visible information is persisted in MongoDB or fetched from external APIs with full CRUD. Current focus is filling feature gaps like the multi-process workspace setup wizard (6 main goals, team roles, tiered subscriptions: Free, Pro, Enterprise), and an extensive admin dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in systematically implementing the remaining features of the Mewayz platform, with a strong emphasis on using real data from external APIs or dynamically generated content, coupled with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for all data. This directive followed a comprehensive platform audit that highlighted many missing functionalities despite initial successful API integrations.

The engineer successfully implemented two major features:
1.  **Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard**: This system, handled by  and exposed via , provides a structured setup process for new users, including goal selection. It was rigorously tested and achieved a 97.1% success rate in backend tests, confirming its functionality and real data integration. A minor Pydantic regex field issue was identified and fixed during this phase.
2.  **Link in Bio Builder System**: This feature, implemented in  and exposed via , allows users to create and manage their Link in Bio pages. It passed all 17 core backend tests with a 100% success rate, confirming full CRUD operations and real data integration. A minor template configuration issue was quickly fixed.

The engineer is currently in the process of implementing the **E-commerce System**. This involves creating new service and API files:  and . The user's most recent instruction is to continue with remaining features in the same way BUT DO NOT TEST IN BETWEEN test after all is done, indicating a shift from per-feature testing to a bulk testing approach after multiple features are developed. The next feature planned for implementation after E-commerce is the Course & Community Platform.

<optional_next_step>
Continue implementing the remaining features systematically, starting with the Course & Community Platform, ensuring real data and full CRUD.
