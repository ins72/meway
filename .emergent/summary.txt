The AI engineer's work on the Mewayz platform has been multi-faceted, beginning with critical environment stabilization, rebranding from ZEPH to Mewayz, and a complete migration of Python/FastAPI components to a pure Laravel/PHP architecture. A significant effort was dedicated to a full frontend redesign to a modern dark theme using Laravel Blade, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js, ensuring professional aesthetics and functional authentication. Stripe payment integration was thoroughly implemented and verified. Later, attention shifted to expanding the dashboard with new features and updating documentation. Most recently, after receiving a comprehensive product requirements document, the AI engineer has paused further feature enhancement to conduct a thorough review of existing backend functionalities (e.g., Courses, Link in Bio, E-commerce), as requested by the user, before proceeding with development.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be an all-in-one Laravel-based business solution, integrating social media management, course creation, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. The initial phase focused on platform stabilization, rebranding, and a complete professional dark-theme frontend rebuild. Key features include a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic feature-based pricing, Instagram management, Link-in-Bio builder, Email Marketing, CRM, and an Admin dashboard. The platform prioritizes a unified, scalable, and mobile-first user experience with robust authentication, analytics, and gamification. The current objective is to expand the newly built dashboard with comprehensive, user-friendly features, ensuring all necessary Blade templates are present and professionally integrated. The user also provided an extensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) detailing all intended functionalities, requiring a comprehensive assessment of existing backend features before further development.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed significant work. This included a successful re-establishment of the Laravel development environment, fixing MariaDB and PHP dependencies, and restarting supervisor processes. The existing Stripe payment integration was thoroughly validated and confirmed to be fully operational after environment variable updates and comprehensive backend testing (95.8% success rate, confirming checkout sessions, webhooks, and database record creation). A new dashboard page () and its corresponding route and sidebar link were added for Stripe subscription management, and a temporary  page was created to verify Stripe functionality end-to-end. Furthermore, extensive documentation update was performed across various  files, covering platform overview, installation, API, architecture, security, development, troubleshooting, and a detailed project scope report.

The very latest user interaction involved the user providing a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) and then clarifying that many backend functionalities for features like courses, link in bio builder, website/site builder, e-commerce, some partnership might already exist, despite the frontend being incomplete. This led the AI engineer to *pause* the previous task of enhancing the partially implemented features (Workspace, Instagram, Link in Bio, Analytics) to first conduct a completely review of the existing backend. The AI engineer is currently in the process of reviewing backend models, starting with  and planning to review controllers and routes next.
