The AI engineer's work focused on elevating the Mewayz v2 platform from an MVP to production-readiness, specifically addressing data persistence, API completeness, and the elimination of mock data. The process was highly iterative, involving extensive auditing, fixing, and re-testing. Initially, the goal was 600-700+ endpoints, which expanded upon deeper discovery. Key challenges included recurring backend startup failures, syntax errors introduced by automated fixers, and complex router inclusion issues in  causing 404s for supposedly implemented endpoints, including authentication routes. Despite achieving a 100% success rate on critical endpoints at one point, full comprehensive tests often revealed regressions or highlighted the limited scope of critical vs. all endpoints. The trajectory shows a persistent effort to identify and properly load all discoverable endpoints, with the latest audit revealing 1,347 endpoints in files but only 198 actually loaded, indicating a major ongoing router registration problem.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) that integrates over 15 business tools into an AI-powered ecosystem. Core features include a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, multi-factor authentication, and a post-registration setup wizard. Key functionalities encompass comprehensive social media management, a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, full CRM/Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, payments, escrow), unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite with a token economy, an extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also required. All data must be persistently stored in MongoDB, strictly avoiding hardcoded or mock data, and ensuring full CRUD operations across all components. The platform mandates mobile optimization, a dark theme, seamless integration for future expansion, and aims for a native-app like user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in an iterative cycle of testing, identifying, and fixing backend issues to achieve full production readiness for Mewayz v2. The last major user request was to re-audit for all 600-700+ API endpoints, missing CRUD, mock data, duplicate files, and missing service/API pairs, and to fix all identified issues to make the platform production-ready with real data.

Initially, a comprehensive audit discovered 1,268 endpoints with 81 issues, and a  applied 122 fixes. However, backend restarts consistently failed with syntax errors (e.g., in , , , , ), preventing routers from loading and causing low test success rates (dropping from an earlier 82.6% to 33.0%, then 6.1%). Despite a brief period of 100% success on critical endpoints, subsequent full tests revealed significant regressions, primarily due to 404s, indicating that many routers were not being properly included in  or had underlying syntax issues in their service files.

The AI engineer applied various manual fixes for these syntax errors (e.g.,  in , unmatched parentheses, invalid characters), and also focused on rectifying incorrect , , and  imports. After these fixes, the success rate for *tested* endpoints improved, reaching 99.5% on 198 discovered endpoints.

However, the user explicitly highlighted that the platform should have 1000+ endpoints, not just ~200. This led to the execution of  (Chat Message 130). This script successfully discovered **1,347 endpoints** in the files, but critically, confirmed that **only 198 were actually showing in OpenAPI**, meaning **1,149 endpoints were not being loaded** due to router registration issues. The script reportedly fixed 117 issues, including adding 35 missing routers to . The last state of the trajectory (Chat Message 131) is that the backend restart *failed* with a 500 error after this discovery and fixing script ran, indicating new syntax issues or configuration problems preventing the server from starting.

<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to debug and fix the backend startup error (500 error) that occurred after running , to ensure all 1,347 discovered endpoints are properly loaded.
