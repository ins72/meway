The previous AI engineer diligently transformed the Mewayz v2 application. Initially, the focus was on rectifying critical backend issues such as  serialization,  errors in JWT authentication, and consolidating duplicate API routes, successfully elevating the platform to a 100% test success rate. A significant portion of the work involved comprehensive auditing to accurately assess implemented features, prompted by user feedback correcting the AI engineer's initial underestimation of the existing codebase's capabilities. Post-audit, the engineer confirmed a vast array of fully operational systems, including Booking, Escrow, Website Builder, and a multi-vendor marketplace, and subsequently fixed remaining minor issues. The latest phase commenced with the user requesting backend development for identified missing features, shifting the focus from fixes to expansion. The engineer began by adding PWA management API, ensuring all new and existing APIs had full CRUD, and then focused on comprehensive documentation, ultimately starting the conversion of an HTML landing page to React.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI-powered features, aiming to be an all-in-one business management solution. Key requirements include a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a post-registration setup wizard for core business tools. Core functionalities span social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also critical. All data must be persistently stored in MongoDB, avoiding hardcoded/mock data, and ensuring full CRUD operations. The platform needs mobile optimization and a native-app-like UX. After significant development, the current FastAPI/React application has achieved comprehensive backend functionality across 13 major systems, reaching a 100% success rate in backend tests. Future aspirations include visual drag-and-drop builders, complete PWA features, and native mobile apps, with a strict clarification that the existing tech stack (FastAPI/React) should not be changed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully achieved a 100% test success rate on the Mewayz v2 backend, confirming all critical business systems (Booking, Escrow, Website Builder, Template Marketplace, Link in Bio, Course & Community, Multi-Vendor Marketplace) are operational. This involved extensive fixes to authentication (JWT, CRUD), database connection handling (e.g.,  serialization,  issues in ), and the addition of comprehensive production-grade features like logging (), configuration (), enterprise security (), performance optimization (, ), and monitoring (,  API).

The user's most recent explicit instruction was to develop the backend of the recommendations (Chat Message 210), referring to the 15% gap identified previously. This involved creating new backend API files: , , , and . These new API routers were then successfully registered in . A crucial subsequent user request was to fix all first make sure we have all crud we need all real data no mock/random/hard coded data (Chat Message 53). In response, the engineer meticulously enhanced all five core APIs (, , , , ) to ensure full CRUD operations using real MongoDB data. This comprehensive backend work was verified with a 100% success rate by the backend testing agent.

Following the backend completion, the user requested detailed screen and technical documentation for native mobile and web. The engineer created  and . The user then provided new, extensive product documentation and requested confirmation of all features, removal of redundant documentation, and updates to important ones. This resulted in the creation of  and , and updates to , while removing outdated files.

The very latest work initiated, as per user instruction (Chat Message 112), is the conversion of a provided HTML landing page into a React component. The engineer has successfully created  and its accompanying CSS file , and a JSX syntax error in the  file has been rectified. The immediate next step planned is to create the  and usage instructions for this new React component.
