The AI engineer's work revolved around transforming Mewayz v2 from an MVP to a fully functional, production-ready platform, focusing heavily on data persistence, API completeness, and eliminating mock data. The initial phase involved systematic cleanup of duplicates and mock data, followed by implementing core features. A significant challenge was ensuring all 674+ API endpoints were fully functional with real CRUD operations, leading to iterative debugging of syntax errors, import issues, and router configurations. Authentication issues were a recurring problem, often causing test failures. The engineer systematically identified missing API routes and services, fixed import errors across multiple files (e.g., , , , ), and regenerated documentation. Despite reaching 100% success on critical endpoints at one point, later full tests revealed significant regressions, indicating the interconnectedness of the codebase. The work concluded with an 82.6% success rate on 69 endpoints, still facing an unknown number of remaining issues identified by an audit.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is conceived as a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA), consolidating over 15 business tools into an AI-powered ecosystem. Core functionalities include a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, multi-factor authentication, and a post-registration setup wizard. Key features encompass comprehensive social media management (Instagram/TikTok/X lead generation, posting), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, full CRM/Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, payments, escrow), unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace (creation, selling). An AI/Automation suite with a token economy, an extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also required. All visible data must be persistently stored in MongoDB (despite an initial MySQL mention), with absolute avoidance of hardcoded or mock data, ensuring full CRUD operations across all system components. The platform mandates mobile optimization, a dark theme, seamless integration for future expansion, and aims for a native-app like user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in an iterative cycle of testing, identifying, and fixing backend issues to achieve full production readiness for Mewayz v2.

The last major effort stemmed from a user request to re-audit for missing CRUD, mock data, duplicate files, and missing service/API pairs, and to fix all found issues, targeting 600-700+ API endpoints. A full backend test was run (Chat Message 137), which catastrophically resulted in a 5.7% success rate, indicating massive system failures despite previous reports of 100% critical endpoint success.

The AI engineer then discovered that only 74 endpoints were actually available (not 600-700+), and the primary issue was failing authentication (403/405 errors). Debugging revealed that the auth endpoints (, ) were returning 404s, even though the  router was reported as included. This led to finding and fixing an  in  (Chat Messages 173-177).

After resolving the  error and restarting the backend, authentication started working (Chat Message 187), and a subsequent comprehensive test achieved a 76.8% success rate (53/69 working endpoints, 32 with real data) (Chat Message 191). Another comprehensive audit identified 189 total issues (Chat Message 193).

A  script was run, applying 5 fixes to 16 failing endpoints (Chat Message 197). However, retesting showed a regression to a 63.8% success rate (Chat Message 203), primarily due to 404s, indicating improper router inclusion in . This led to a series of fixes for missing imports and incorrect , , and  definitions in files like , , , and  (Chat Messages 204-266).

After these import and definition fixes, the backend stabilized and a test showed an 82.6% success rate (57/69 working endpoints) (Chat Message 268). The AI engineer's immediate next step, as indicated by the last message, is to run a final comprehensive audit.
