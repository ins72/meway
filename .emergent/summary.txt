The previous AI engineer initiated a Laravel 11 application, addressing an authentication vulnerability by implementing a  middleware. The user had shifted the frontend from React to Laravel Blade, aiming for 100% feature completion with configurations managed via an admin dashboard. The core task at handover was a comprehensive codebase audit, explicitly requested by the user, covering documentation, Blade files, routes, and controllers. The AI engineer systematically read , , and then proceeded to audit numerous Blade files within , the  routes, and started with controllers, specifically  and other API controllers. A known issue requiring attention is the incorrect use of  instead of  in controllers. The engineer was in the process of completing the controller audit and was about to create updated documentation based on the findings.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native, all-in-one business solution. It integrates social media, digital commerce, education, CRM, and marketing. Key features include a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and tiered subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise). Authentication will support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, and future biometric options. Core functionalities encompass Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, and Analytics. All features are centrally managed via an Admin Dashboard. The platform must be mobile-optimized as a PWA, built on Laravel with MySQL (MariaDB), and persist all data. Critically, all environment variables and API keys must be visually managed through the admin dashboard, targeting 100% feature completion.

<code_architecture>
The codebase is a Laravel 11 application with a modular structure:

-   : These controllers handle specific API functionalities like Analytics, Health, Website Builder, Escrow, Booking, Financials, AI, Biometric Auth, Real-Time, Workspace Setup, Link Shortener, Referral, and Template Marketplace. They encapsulate the business logic for these features.  was recently examined for its logic.
-   : This custom middleware was created to resolve authentication issues, replacing the default  for secure API access. It's critical for API security.
-   : Eloquent models like , , , , and  define the database schema and provide an ORM interface for data interaction for various features.
-   : These files define the database tables and their schema, including new tables for features like Escrow, Booking, Link Shortener, Referral, and Template Marketplace. They ensure the database structure supports the application's features.
-   : These Blade files form the frontend UI. Important files like  and  are vital for workspace setup and the main dashboard. During the audit, the previous engineer systematically read all Blade files, including , , and authentication views, to understand the UI structure and content.
-    and : These files define the application's routes.  includes all new API controller routes, secured by , ensuring correct routing for backend services.  handles web-based routes.  was read during the audit.
-   , , , , : These Markdown files track audit progress, findings, testing results, and overall communication.  and  were read to understand the project's status.

<current_work>
The Laravel 11 application is currently established with a MariaDB backend and an initial Blade-based UI. A significant authentication issue was resolved by replacing  with  middleware across API routes, enhancing security. Backend infrastructure for core features like Escrow and Advanced Booking systems is complete, including new models, migrations, and foreign key corrections.

The multi-workspace system's backend (setup, features, goals, subscription plans, team invitations) has been built, with corresponding migrations and a  for initial data. Frontend Blade views (, ) and web routes for this system have been created, and database issues related to the  table were fixed.

Additionally, backend scaffolding for Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace features is complete, including their respective controllers, models, migrations, and API routes.

The immediate and ongoing task, following an explicit user request, is a comprehensive audit of the entire codebase. The previous AI engineer successfully read documentation files (, , , , ). All Blade files in  have been systematically audited to understand the frontend structure. Route auditing has commenced with , and controller auditing has begun with  and other API controllers. A critical known issue that needs addressing is the incorrect use of  instead of  in backend controllers for user authentication.
