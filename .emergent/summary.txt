The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Mewayz project, an all-in-one business platform, following a detailed specification. Initially, there was a significant environmental mismatch: the system prompt indicated a FastAPI/React setup, but the existing codebase was a comprehensive Laravel backend with a Flutter mobile application. The AI engineer efficiently identified this discrepancy and pivoted to working with the existing Laravel/Flutter structure.

Key challenges involved setting up the correct PHP and Composer environment, installing necessary extensions, and resolving MySQL database issues, including setting up a local MariaDB instance. A recurring problem was frontend asset compilation via Vite, which required systematic installation of numerous Node.js packages and iterative build attempts. The AI engineer also tackled unexpected redirects caused by an  middleware and  configuration, manually fixing them to enable access to the main application.

Later, the focus shifted to enhancing existing features and implementing the professional UI/UX, particularly for the Flutter mobile app and Laravel web authentication pages. This involved extensive dependency resolution for Flutter, API URL configuration, and a complete overhaul of the login and registration pages to match Mewayz's dark theme and branding. At the end, the engineer was performing comprehensive testing and identified critical loading issues on the Laravel application.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project is an all-in-one business suite encompassing social media management, courses, e-commerce, CRM, and email marketing. It requires a Laravel 10+ web application for desktop use and Flutter 3.x applications for mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) native experiences. The architecture is API-first (RESTful with Laravel Sanctum), backed by MySQL 8.0+. Critical third-party integrations include Stripe for payments, ElasticEmail for email services, and Pusher/WebSockets for real-time features.

A precise design system is mandated, with specific color palettes ( background,  widget background, etc.), Inter font family, and defined spacing. Authentication must support Email/Password, Google/Apple/Microsoft OAuth, 2FA, and biometrics. A multi-workspace system with role-based access and a three-tier subscription model are required. Core features include Instagram lead generation, multi-platform posting, a link-in-bio builder, CRM/email marketing, e-commerce, course creation, a website builder, booking system, analytics, and a template marketplace.

The user explicitly requested that all features be more in depth and the Flutter app works completely for mobile. Additionally, the overall combination should have a full professional feeling + look. The latest request is for full testing fix any big and or minor issues frontent/visually and backend and review EVERY file to check for current feature list and to fix/make anything that could be improved more in depth.

The Mewayz application features a comprehensive Laravel backend serving as the API and web application, alongside a Flutter application for mobile and desktop experiences.



**Key Files and their Importance:**

*   : **Crucial** for storing environment-specific variables like database credentials, API keys (Stripe, ElasticEmail), and the  flag. Modified to include correct database settings and API keys, and  to bypass installation redirect.
*   : Middleware that caused redirects to an install page. The  function it called was not found initially, leading to creation of a dummy function and then ultimately bypassed by setting  in .
*   : Contains helper functions.  was temporarily added here, and  function (which pulls branding from settings) was identified as the source of branding inconsistency.
*   : Enhanced to provide actual social media account connection, post scheduling, and analytics functionality, moving beyond  comments.
*   : Enhanced to include full CRUD operations for bio sites, link management, theme configuration, and QR code generation.
*   , , , : Core Eloquent models. New migrations and models were created/modified to align database schema with feature requirements and fix testing failures.  was updated to include new columns and  relationship.
*   : Database schema definitions. New migrations were created for , , , and . Existing migrations like  were modified to align column names.
*   : Laravel Blade template that checks , causing the initial redirect.
*   , : Livewire Blade components for authentication. These were completely revamped to match the Mewayz dark theme, branding, and professional UI/UX, replacing the old ZEPH branding and colorful design.
*   : Configuration for Vite, used to compile Laravel frontend assets. Required installing numerous npm <command>

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate and fix the critical loading issues observed on the Laravel web application (Chat Message 660).
- Perform a detailed review of *every* file to identify the current feature list and implement in-depth improvements.
- Fix any remaining big or minor issues, both visually on the frontend and functionally on the backend, beyond those already addressed.
- Address the lack of social API integrations, as the user stated, i do not have most social api yet.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the previous AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive testing and review phase, as requested by the user (do full testing fix any big and or minor issues frontent/visually and backend and review EVERY file to check for current feature list and to fix/make anything that could be improved more in depth).

The work involved:
1.  **Backend Testing**: Initial backend tests passed at 87.5% success rate (21/24 tests), indicating some remaining issues.
2.  **Model/Migration Fixes**: The engineer created or modified several Laravel models and migrations to align with feature requirements and fix testing failures. This included:
    *   Creating models for , , .
    *   Creating migrations for , , , and .
    *   Updating  migration to use  and  columns, and the  model to include new columns and a  relationship.
3.  **Codebase Inventory**: A comprehensive review of Laravel controllers (), API routes (), and models () was initiated to understand the existing feature set.
4.  **Frontend Testing**: After backend fixes and inventory, comprehensive frontend testing was conducted.
5.  **Critical Loading Issues Identified**: The most recent action was the observation that the Laravel web application has critical loading issues despite previous successful loading and screenshot captures. This suggests a regression or a deeper underlying problem that needs immediate attention.

The current state is that the Laravel backend and Flutter frontend are deployed, database migrations are complete, and core API controllers (Auth, Social Media, BioSite) have been enhanced. The authentication pages (Login, Register) for the Laravel web app have been visually transformed to meet the professional Mewayz dark theme specifications. However, the critical loading issue on the Laravel web application requires investigation.
