The previous AI engineer diligently focused on migrating Mewayz platform features from a Laravel-based specification to the existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. The process was systematic, prioritizing core functionalities and addressing user feedback iteratively. Key achievements include centralizing JWT authentication, integrating Google OAuth and Stripe, and extensive social media/email API integrations. A major effort was the implementation of a comprehensive AI token ecosystem, involving backend logic for token consumption, allowance, and management, alongside corresponding frontend UI and navigation. The engineer also initiated the enhancement of complex frontend pages (Gamified Analytics, Admin Dashboard) and a multi-step onboarding system. Documentation was updated, and Laravel remnants are being systematically removed. The work flow demonstrates a commitment to feature parity, quality, and responsiveness to user instructions, with frequent backend testing and visual checks.

The Mewayz Platform is an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution aiming to re-implement all features from an extensive Laravel-based documentation into the current FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. Key functionalities include: a multi-workspace system with RBAC and user invitations; tiered subscriptions (Free, Pro, Enterprise); a multi-step onboarding wizard for new workspace setup with 6 main goals (Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, plus one AI-decided); Google/Apple/Email authentication with Stripe payment integration. Comprehensive business tools cover Instagram management, a drag & drop Link in Bio builder, CRM & Email Marketing (with ElasticMail), a Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, escrow), unified and gamified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and AI & Automation Features (content/image generation, SEO, chatbots). An extensive Admin Dashboard is required for platform control. All visible data must be stored in MongoDB and optimized for Flutter web loader/mobile apps, with mock data for population. A professional, mobile-first design aligning with a specified dark theme is critical. A new requirement for the AI feature is a token ecosystem where users pay for tokens, can buy more, and subscribers get a monthly allowance per workspace, with owner-controlled limits. The platform needs to seamlessly integrate all features with room for expansion, ensuring all visible information is stored in MongoDB, not hardcoded.
