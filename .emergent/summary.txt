The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Mewayz v2 application from an MVP, focusing heavily on backend stability, monetization features, and robust administrative systems. Initial tasks included fixing ObjectId serialization, enhancing JWT authentication, and converting the landing page to a responsive React component. The development then shifted to comprehensive backend services for referrals, template marketplaces, subscriptions, and AI token purchases, all integrated into  and thoroughly tested.

The most recent phase concentrated on frontend modernization, driven by explicit user feedback. The engineer initially updated frontend specifications documentation but then pivoted to direct code implementation upon user clarification. Key efforts involved redesigning the dashboard, fixing responsive issues (button sizing, touch targets), professionalizing UI elements (removing emojis, replacing with SVG icons), and refining authentication forms. Iterative user feedback guided fixes for icon-text overlap in forms and streamlining mobile navigation, culminating in a professional, enterprise-ready UI with a focus on seamless user experience across devices. The work is now very focused on polishing the frontend's responsiveness and aesthetics.

The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with integrated AI capabilities, serving as an all-in-one business management solution. Key functionalities include a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a post-registration setup wizard. Core features span social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are critical. All data is persistently stored in MongoDB, ensuring full CRUD operations with real data, optimized for mobile, and offering a native-app-like user experience.

The existing application has established comprehensive backend functionality across 13 major systems, boasting 100% test success rates. Recent efforts included integrating visual builders, PWA features, native mobile app support, and refining a React landing page for production. The user explicitly requested an Admin Plan Management system allowing comprehensive control over plan features, limits, pricing (monthly, yearly, launch), and enablement/disabling of plans per workspace, not merely individual user subscriptions. Frontend work recently shifted to rebuilding the dashboard and general UI/UX to match the existing landing page's professional aesthetic.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (PyMongo, AsyncIOMotor), JWT.
-   **Frontend**: React, CSS (for styling and responsiveness), Intersection Observer.
-   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Ingress, Supervisor, environment variables.
-   **Architecture**: Modular (API, Services, Core), CRUD operations.
-   **Data Handling**: Real data persistence, BSON ObjectId (though UUIDs preferred).
-   **Security**: JWT, MFA.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend structure.



-   : Central FastAPI app, orchestrating backend API routers. It continuously integrates new API endpoints, now supporting 132 services.
-   : The foundational React landing page, serving as the design and aesthetic reference for all new frontend components. It was optimized for responsiveness and animations.
-    and : Critical new files implementing the comprehensive admin system for plan definitions, features, limits, pricing, and availability. Fully implemented with 13 endpoints and 100% test success.
-    and : New files to analyze plan change impact on subscriptions. Core functionality is 61.5% complete.
-   : Main React application file, responsible for routing and integrating , , and all pages/components. It was updated to include new dashboard, authentication, and onboarding pages and their routes.
-    and : Newly created for a consistent application shell/dashboard layout, integrating a sidebar and main content area. This is central to the new dashboard structure.
-   , , , , and their respective CSS files: New dashboard pages created to start building out the core application functionality within the new app shell, replacing previous placeholder content.
-   , , and : New authentication pages designed to match the professional landing page aesthetic, with significant updates to replace emoji icons with professional SVGs and fix layout issues (e.g., icon overlap).
-    and : Newly created to provide a professional, multi-step onboarding process, including plan selection and subscription setup.
-   : New file created to house global CSS styles, consistent design tokens, and utility classes, ensuring a uniform look and feel across the application, especially for glassmorphism effects and responsive design.
-   : Updated to handle authentication logic, token management, and user data, essential for protecting routes and providing user context. Changes were made to ensure proper token handling and error responses.
-   : The stylesheet for the landing page, serving as a primary reference for styling elements like responsive navigation and general aesthetics for the new dashboard. It was updated to support new responsive navigation logic.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining implementation for the  service/API (currently 61.5% operational).
-   Implement other critical missing admin features identified in the audit: Admin Workspace Subscription Management, Customer Notification System, Advanced Admin Analytics, and Operational Admin Tools (search, filter, export, communication, bulk operations).
-   Continue building additional professional frontend pages (e.g., Analytics Dashboard, CRM System, Admin Panel) as requested by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a deep refinement of the frontend's user interface and experience, specifically addressing user feedback concerning visual professionalism and responsiveness. The prior work involved creating a new comprehensive dashboard structure (, , , etc.), new authentication pages (, ), and an , all aimed at aligning with the  aesthetic.

The user provided critical feedback, highlighting several issues:
1.  **Form Icons Overlap:** Icons within login/register input fields were overlapping text.
2.  **Redundant Tablet Navigation:** On tablet sizes, both a hamburger menu and full navigation links were visible, leading to redundancy.
3.  **Login/Start Free Trial in Hamburger Menu:** On smaller screens, the Login and Start Free Trial buttons were not moved into the hamburger menu.

The AI engineer addressed these systematically:
*   **Form Icon Overlap:** Successfully redesigned forms (in  and ) to place icons *outside* input fields in dedicated containers, ensuring no text overlap and a cleaner, professional look. Related CSS (e.g., in  and ) was updated to support this new external icon design.
*   **Tablet Navigation Redundancy:** Fixed by adjusting the responsive breakpoints for mobile navigation, ensuring the hamburger menu activates at 1024px instead of 768px, removing the redundant display of full navigation links on tablets. The sidebar overlay click handler was also fixed.
*   **Login/Start Free Trial in Hamburger Menu:** The AI engineer was actively working on this. The  was being modified to move the 'Login' and 'Start Free Trial' buttons into the mobile menu ( component within the LandingPage). The last action taken was to update the old mobile menu styles to remove conflicts, indicating this task is still ongoing. The current state is that the forms and general responsive layout have been significantly professionalized, and the navigation is being further refined for mobile/tablet screen sizes.

Continue refining the mobile navigation by ensuring the 'Login' and 'Start Free Trial' buttons are correctly integrated into the hamburger menu on smaller screens.
