The provided trajectory details the continuation of development on the Mewayz platform, handed over from a previous AI engineer. Initially, the application was a consolidated Laravel backend with the Flutter frontend completely removed. My work began with diagnosing and fixing critical infrastructure issues, including resolving  command not found errors, installing necessary PHP extensions and Composer, setting up MariaDB, configuring Laravel via Supervisor, and resolving Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help issues during frontend asset compilation.

After stabilizing the core backend, the focus shifted to feature enhancements. I successfully implemented Stripe payment integration, including database schema, models, controllers, and API routes. Subsequently, a comprehensive 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard was developed and fully integrated, featuring dynamic feature-based pricing. Following this, an Instagram Management system was built, encompassing account management, post scheduling, analytics, and hashtag research, with significant architectural fixes to ensure proper data relationships with the  model.

The trajectory concludes with the user highlighting potential duplication of existing Link in Bio and Website Builder features, requesting a thorough review to avoid redundancy and a comprehensive update of all testing instructions and documentation. I have initiated this review and attempted to update documentation.

The overarching goal for the Mewayz platform is to be a comprehensive all-in-one business solution. Initially, it involved consolidating a Laravel backend (which absorbed a FastAPI codebase) and a Flutter frontend (migrated from Supabase). A major shift occurred when the Flutter frontend was completely removed, refocusing development solely on the Laravel backend and its web interface. The primary objective became ensuring the Laravel application was fully installed, tested, and functional, including core functionalities, asset compilation for its web interface, user/admin management, and various API endpoints.

Following this, a detailed product vision was provided, outlining features like a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard (with 6 main goals and 40+ features, feature-based pricing), Instagram Management, Link in Bio builder, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Template Marketplace, Gamification, Team Collaboration, and an Admin Dashboard. The user explicitly requested to proceed with Phase 1 of this roadmap, which included the Enhanced Workspace Setup, Feature-Based Pricing, Instagram Management, and Link in Bio Builder. The current task is to review existing Link in Bio and Website Builder functionality to prevent duplication and update all documentation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Laravel**: Primary PHP framework for backend.
-   **MariaDB/MySQL**: Relational database.
-   **PHP & Composer**: Core language and dependency manager.
-   **Node.js/NPM/Vite**: JS runtime, package manager, and build tool for assets.
-   **Alpine.js/Livewire**: JS framework and full-stack framework for Laravel's dynamic frontend.
-   **Stripe**: Payment gateway for transactions.
-   **Laravel Folio**: Page-based routing for Laravel web interface.

<code_architecture>
The application architecture is centered around a Laravel backend, with the Flutter frontend completely removed.



-   ****: Defines all API endpoints. Updated to include 40+ initial routes from FastAPI, and new routes for Stripe payments, Workspace Setup, and Instagram Management.
-   ****: New controller responsible for handling Stripe-related payment logic, including package fetching and payment intent creation.
-   ****: New controller managing the multi-step workspace onboarding wizard, including goal selection, feature pricing, and branding configuration.
-   ****: New controller for managing Instagram accounts, post scheduling, hashtag research, and analytics, integrated with the  model.
-   ****: New Eloquent model to represent and interact with the  table for Stripe.
-   ****: New Eloquent model for managing workspace entities, linked to the  table.
-   **, , **: New Eloquent models for Instagram-related data, linked to .
-   ****: Modified to correct table name references for database queries.
-   ****: Modified to include a  relationship to the new  model.
-   ****: Multiple new migration files were created to set up tables for Stripe payments, Workspaces, and Instagram features. An additional migration was created specifically to fix foreign key constraints in Instagram tables to properly reference the  table.
-   ****: Configuration was updated to ensure the Laravel backend runs using  instead of  and to manage MariaDB.
-   ****: Key environment variables like  were confirmed, and  was added to enable Stripe integration.
-   ****: Updated multiple times to resolve Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help errors and add missing frontend packages for asset compilation, critical for the Laravel web interface.
-   ****: New static HTML test pages (, , , ) were created for direct testing of new features.
-   ****: New file created to store the detailed product requirements provided by the user.
-   ****: New file providing instructions for accessing the deployed application and test pages.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed the full implementation and comprehensive backend testing of the **Instagram Management System**, as part of Phase 2 of the user's detailed roadmap. This feature now includes API endpoints for account management, post scheduling, analytics, and hashtag research, achieving a 100% success rate in testing after architectural fixes (aligning with the  model and updating foreign keys).

Before this, the AI engineer had successfully implemented **Stripe Payment Integration**, creating a new migration, model, controller, and API routes, along with a test page (). This was thoroughly tested and confirmed working. Furthermore, the **6-step Workspace Setup Wizard** was enhanced to include dynamic feature-based pricing and 6 main business goals, with all 10 API endpoints for this workflow also passing tests with 100% success. A test page () for this wizard was also created.

The initial work involved extensive setup and stabilization, including installing PHP, Composer, and MariaDB, fixing supervisor configurations to correctly run Laravel, resolving frontend asset compilation issues (Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help, ), and performing initial comprehensive backend testing (achieving 84.2% success). An issue with Livewire authentication on the web interface was noted and deferred after confirming the backend API authentication was functional.

The user's most recent explicit request (Message 342) is to review the existing drag and drop link in bio AND website builder to avoid duplication and to fully update all testing instructions and documentation (). The AI engineer has initiated this review process, exploring relevant controllers, models, routes, and views, and has made an attempt to update .
