The previous AI engineer successfully initiated work on the Mewayz Platform, transitioning from an assumed React/FastAPI to the confirmed Laravel/PHP architecture. A significant portion of the work involved resolving deep environmental issues, including PHP and MariaDB installation, and consistently debugging numerous database migration foreign key conflicts (UUID vs. BigInt). The engineer then focused on implementing icon standardization across Blade templates by enhancing a central component and introducing a dedicated CSS file.

Following this, a new, extensive product requirements document was provided by the user, outlining features for Mewayz v2 and, notably, a contradictory Next.js/React technical stack. The AI engineer proceeded with implementation within the existing Laravel context, focusing on populating the database with workspace goals and features, developing a multi-process workspace setup wizard, integrating PWA features, establishing a per-workspace subscription system, and building a comprehensive admin dashboard. The immediate next step involves implementing real-time WebSocket collaboration.

The Mewayz Platform v2 aims to be an all-in-one business solution, evolving beyond its initial MVP. The user's core request was to fully implement Phases 2, 3, and 4, which included comprehensive features like tiered pricing, advanced UX, professional pages, team management, white-label solutions, AI automation, and internationalization.

Crucially, the user later provided an extensive Mewayz Laravel PWA - Development Brief outlining core features such as a multi-workspace system, social media management, Link in Bio, courses, e-commerce, CRM, website builder, booking, financial management, analytics, and AI tools. A professional authentication system with Google/Apple sign-in, a multi-process workspace setup wizard (6 main goals, 40 features, team invitations), and a 3-tier subscription model were specifically requested. All data, including goals and features, must be saved in MySQL, not hardcoded. The platform should be optimized for a mobile PWA experience. The user additionally requested an extensive admin dashboard to manage the entire environment, including users, pricing, and plans, and the implementation of real-time WebSocket collaboration.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer completed the initial phase of icon standardization by enhancing the  component, creating a dedicated  stylesheet, and applying these changes across various Blade templates like dashboard views and content builders to address oversized icons and visual inconsistencies.

During this process, significant environment issues were encountered. The AI successfully installed PHP, configured MariaDB/MySQL, and systematically debugged numerous database migration failures. These failures primarily stemmed from foreign key type mismatches (UUIDs referencing bigint IDs in the  table) and conflicts due to already existing tables. The engineer persistently dropped and recreated tables, and corrected migration files (, , , ) to align foreign key types with the  table's  ID.

After stabilizing the environment and fixing initial migrations, the focus shifted to implementing the comprehensive product features outlined by the user. This included:
1.  **Database Seeding:** Created and ran seeders for 10 main workspace goals and 48 features, and subscription plans to populate the database.
2.  **Workspace Setup Wizard:** Developed the initial UI component (), controller (), view (), and corresponding models.
3.  **PWA Features:** Added core PWA files including , , , and  for enhanced mobile experience.
4.  **Per-Workspace Subscriptions:** Initiated the implementation of a sophisticated subscription system, creating new migration files and models for , , and related entities to support tiered pricing and feature access.
5.  **Advanced Admin Dashboard:** Started building the comprehensive admin interface, creating , , , and .
6.  **Real-time WebSocket Collaboration:** The engineer has just begun the implementation of the WebSocket real-time collaboration system, which is the immediate task.

The platform has a functional Laravel backend and a progressively enhanced frontend, with core database structures and initial logic for new features now in place. Environment stability was achieved through persistent debugging, though the comprehensive backend test showed a 70% success rate, indicating further checks may be needed on specific endpoints.
