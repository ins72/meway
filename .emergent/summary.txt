<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's primary goal was to achieve full feature parity for the Mewayz platform, migrating extensive functionalities from a Laravel-based documentation to an existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. The process involved a significant overhaul of both backend and frontend components. Key backend efforts included centralizing JWT authentication in , integrating Google OAuth, Stripe payments, and social media/email APIs (X, TikTok, ElasticMail), along with OpenAI for AI features. On the frontend, the engineer focused on creating numerous new pages to accommodate the expanded features, fixing rendering issues by simplifying complex components when necessary, and integrating the new backend functionalities. The work also involved extensive documentation updates, removing Laravel-specific content and ensuring current platform status. The engineer systematically addressed feature implementation, tested backend integrations, and incrementally added frontend components, aiming for a professional result and comprehensive feature coverage. The trajectory shows a systematic approach to adding features, fixing issues as they arise (e.g., import errors, rendering issues), and repeatedly confirming with the user about the next steps.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution. The core objective is to re-implement all features from an extensive Laravel-based documentation into the current FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack.
Key requirements include:
*   **Multi-Workspace System:** Users can create multiple workspaces with RBAC (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer), user invitations, and easy switching.
*   **Subscription Tiers:** Free (10 features limit), Pro (/feature/month, 0/year), and Enterprise (.5/feature/month, 5/year for premium/whitelabel features).
*   **Multi-step Onboarding Wizard:** For new workspace setup (6 main goals: Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, plus one decided by the AI engineer), with goal visibility based on workspace access.
*   **Authentication:** Google, Apple, and Email login, with secure Stripe payment integration (webhooks, saved methods).
*   **Comprehensive Business Tools:**
    *   Instagram management (filtering, AI recommendations, content analysis, lead generation).
    *   Drag & Drop Link in Bio builder (custom domains, analytics, dynamic content, e-commerce integration, contact forms, QR code generation).
    *   CRM & Email Marketing (contact management, lead scoring, automated workflows, ElasticMail integration, bulk account creation).
    *   Website Builder (no-code, responsive, SEO, third-party integrations).
    *   Booking System (calendar integration, service management, reminders, payment).
    *   Financial Management (invoicing, escrow, wallet, revenue tracking).
    *   Analytics (unified, gamified, custom reporting, API access).
    *   Course & Community System (video hosting, quizzes, progress tracking, gamification, live streaming).
    *   Template Marketplace (user-generated, sellable templates across categories).
    *   AI & Automation Features (content/image generation, SEO optimization, chatbots, predictive analytics, automated workflows).
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Extensive control over plans, pricing, and platform settings.
*   **Data Storage:** All visible data must be stored in MongoDB (not hardcoded), optimized for Flutter web loader and mobile apps, with mock data for population.
*   **Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation to  and .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into enhancing the Mewayz platform's frontend and ensuring backend integrations.

On the **backend**, the focus was on AI integration:
*   The usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]
              [-o ORGANIZATION] [-t {openai,azure}]
              [--api-version API_VERSION] [--azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT]

                        Which organization to run as (will use your default
                        organization if not specified)
  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.
                        'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning'
  --azure-endpoint AZURE_ENDPOINT
                        The Azure endpoint, e.g.
                        'https://endpoint.openai.azure.com'
  --azure-ad-token AZURE_AD_TOKEN
                        A token from Azure Active Directory,
                        https://www.microsoft.com/en-
                        us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-
                        id
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit library was installed via pip.
*   A new file, , was created to house the AI logic.
*   The  was added to .
*   Crucially, comprehensive AI endpoints for content creation, analysis, and business intelligence were added directly into  after previous attempts to include them via  proved ineffective.
*   Backend tests () confirmed the newly added AI endpoints were functional with a 92.3% success rate, validating the OpenAI integration.

On the **frontend**, the engineer was creating numerous advanced pages to match the extensive documentation:
*   New pages such as , , , , and  were created.
*   Additional comprehensive pages like , , , and  were also generated.
*   Associated routing for all these newly created pages was added to .
*   Minor import errors in these newly created components (e.g., missing Heroicon imports) were identified and fixed.
*   The  and  were briefly revisited to check for issues and potential re-implementation of their complex versions, although actual re-implementation work wasn't detailed.

**Documentation cleanup** was also initiated:
*   The content of  and  was updated to reflect  and , and to remove Laravel-specific information.
The last action was an attempt to remove redundant Laravel documentation files.
