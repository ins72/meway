<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully implemented a significant portion of the Mewayz Laravel application, including the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard, Instagram Management System, and Email Marketing Hub. Authentication via Laravel Sanctum and Stripe integration were also established. However, the trajectory reveals a persistent critical issue: the underlying PHP runtime and Supervisor service repeatedly fail to operate, resulting in PHP not found and unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock no such file errors. Despite these core backend infrastructure failures, the AI engineer continued to develop new features, creating controllers and routes for OAuth, AI functionalities, PWA, Admin Dashboard, Link-in-Bio, Template Marketplace, and Gamification. Frontend testing agents showed some success in resolving frontend container issues, but backend testing consistently reported critical infrastructure failures, leading to a discrepancy in the declared 100% completion status. The primary challenge transferred is stabilizing the backend environment to enable full functionality and reliable testing.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform is an all-in-one Laravel-based business solution offering social media management (Instagram), course creation, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. It targets a unified, scalable, and mobile-first experience with robust analytics and gamification. A central feature is a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic, feature-based pricing (Free, Professional, Enterprise plans). Core functionalities include a Link-in-Bio builder, Email Marketing Hub, comprehensive CRM, and a Template Marketplace. The objective is to expand the dashboard dynamically via Blade templates, ensuring backend functionalities are robust. So far, the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard (Phase 1) is complete, and the Instagram Management System and Email Marketing Hub (Phase 2) are substantially implemented. The user explicitly requested a full audit of existing features against documentation, removal of old test results, creation of new comprehensive tests, and updating all documentation, followed by implementing all remaining features to achieve 100% completion, including Google/Apple OAuth, ElasticEmail, and AI integrations.

<code_architecture>
The Mewayz application follows a standard Laravel architecture, with a clear separation between frontend (Blade, JS) and backend (PHP, Laravel). The core application logic resides within the  directory, structured by concerns like , , and . Routes are defined in  for API endpoints and  for traditional web routes. Database schema changes are managed via migrations.


-   ****: Modified for Stripe and MariaDB connection details, and  for Sanctum.
-   ****: Critical for Stripe payment processing.
-   ****: Many controllers handle specific feature APIs.  for Instagram features,  for email,  for setup. New controllers created include , , , , , , and , responsible for their respective feature APIs.
-   ****: Eloquent models map to database tables. Key models like , , , ,  had  assignment and status casting fixes. Numerous new models (, , etc.) were added for new features.  was modified to include new CRM related fields.
-   ****: Prevents constant re-definition.
-   ****:  middleware was uncommented for Sanctum's session-based authentication.
-   ** & **: Authentication and Sanctum configuration adjustments.
-   ****: Essential for defining database schema. Numerous new migrations were added for Workspace Setup, Instagram, Email Marketing, OAuth columns for  table, and CRM columns for  table, with attention to correct foreign key types.
-   ** & **: New dynamic Blade templates for Instagram and Email Marketing dashboards.
-   ****: Modified to integrate PWA manifests and service worker.
-   ****: New view for PWA offline capability.
-   **, , **: New files for Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality.
-   ****: Updated with routes for all new controllers (Workspace Setup, Team Management, OAuth, Instagram, Email Marketing, AI, PWA, Admin, Link-in-Bio, Template Marketplace, Gamification).
-   ****: Updated with routes for dynamic dashboard pages and the new PWA offline page.
-   ****: Continuously updated to reflect testing outcomes and audit summaries, though its content was completely replaced multiple times.
-   ****: A new file created by the AI to summarize its audit findings.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on achieving 100% feature completion as per the detailed Mewayz Platform Documentation. This involved creating new controllers and associated routes for previously missing or partially implemented features:
- **PWA Optimization**: New files , , , a new controller , and an  view were created.  was updated for PWA support.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: The existing  was replaced with a comprehensive version to fix issues.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A new controller  was created.
- **Link in Bio Builder**: A new controller  was created.
- **Template Marketplace**: A new controller  was created.
- **Gamification System**: A new controller  was created.
- All new controller routes were added to  and  where applicable.

Despite these additions and a declaration of 100% complete based on frontend testing, repeated backend testing attempts using  consistently failed with CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE: Cannot test backend API: Failed to connect to server. PHP runtime not found. The core backend environment remains problematic, hindering full functionality verification. The AI's last action was to attempt another backend test and then indicate it has a comprehensive overview for a final summary.
