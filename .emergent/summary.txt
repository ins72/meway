The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Mewayz Platform from a monolithic Python script into a modular FastAPI and React application. The initial phase focused on migrating all features, achieving 100% platform completion. Subsequently, the work evolved into professionalizing the codebase by establishing a one-to-one mapping between API routes and services, eliminating mock data, and integrating real database interactions. Numerous scripts were developed to audit and fix issues, including  and various  scripts. Latest efforts concentrated on the final elimination of random data, completing  module inclusions, and addressing service method implementation issues. Significant progress was made, with the backend achieving 84.1% module success and 105 operational API endpoints, but 32 random data calls and 11 failing API endpoints remain, signifying ongoing work to fully integrate real external data and complete service logic.

The Mewayz Platform is a mobile-first PWA business solution built on FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. It aims to provide comprehensive features including multi-workspace support, RBAC, user invitations, Stripe subscriptions, Google/Email authentication, multi-step onboarding, Instagram management, Link in Bio, CRM, Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, Analytics, Course & Community, Template Marketplace, and an AI/Automation suite with a token economy, all managed via an Admin Dashboard. Key technical constraints include exclusive MongoDB usage, mobile optimization, dark theme support, and strict avoidance of hardcoded data. The current development phase is crucial for transitioning from mock data to real data, enhancing user experience, retention, and conversion rates, establishing a robust and scalable code structure, and completely removing legacy Laravel components. The preceding phase successfully migrated the platform to a modular and scalable architecture.

- : The central FastAPI application entry point. It has been extensively modified and refined through  and  to dynamically import and include all 63  instances from , manage middleware (CORS), and connect to core infrastructure modules.
- : The initial monolithic Python script, now marked as 100% PLATFORM COMPLETION after features were migrated.
- : Contains FastAPI  modules. Numerous new files (e.g., , , ) were created and refined to ensure a one-to-one mapping with service files and the overall modular structure, and to handle new functionalities like admin configuration.
- : Houses business logic. Many new files were created and existing ones (e.g., , , , , ) were systematically modified to replace  and other mock data with real database operations and external API calls. Syntax errors (e.g.,  outside async functions, indentation) and missing service instance declarations were also addressed.  was introduced for real data seeding.
- : This directory contains foundational modules. New files like , , , , , , and  were created to centralize and modularize key infrastructure components like professional logging, security, multi-payment processor integration, caching (Redis), file storage (Backblaze B2), and email services.
- : Crucial for tracking development progress, testing outcomes, and communication. It documents successful API-service mapping, database integration, and outstanding issues.
- Utility Scripts (, , , , , ): These scripts were systematically created and used to identify, audit, and fix specific issues such as mock data usage, syntax errors, and missing service implementations across the codebase in an automated fashion.

- Eliminate the remaining 32 instances of  and other mock data usage.
- Fix the 11 identified failing API endpoints, addressing issues in services such as Customer Experience and Social Email.
- Implement comprehensive data population scripts to fetch and store real data from external APIs.
- Complete all missing external API integrations (e.g., specific social media APIs, comprehensive payment integrations, Backblaze B2, SendGrid/Mailgun).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the final phase of a comprehensive backend audit, aiming to eliminate all remaining random data generation and ensure all application modules are fully functional with real data.

The user's explicit request was to run a full audit and fix anything and everything that is currently not working, using random value, not properly gathering data that should come from external api like social media... and make sure /app/backend/main.py is complete for all files we have.

The AI engineer's actions and the current status are as follows:
1.  **Backend Structure Refinement**: Created core infrastructure modules under  (e.g., , , , , , , ) to professionalize the architecture as per the audit requirements.
2.  ** Enhancement**: Modified  to include new system endpoints (, ) and a new  API router. The backend was restarted and is now running.
3.  **Random Data Elimination**: Created and executed . This script aimed to address the remaining 33 random data calls. The latest audit report (Chat 191) indicates that 32 random data calls still remain, showing progress but not full completion.
4.  **Service Fixes**: Various issues were identified and addressed, including:
    *   Syntax errors (e.g., / mismatches, indentation) in files like  and .
    *   Missing service instance declarations at the end of service files (, ).
    *   Logical issues like recursive calls in  were fixed, and API mappings were corrected.
    *   Installation of missing  package in .
5.  **Testing Status**: The latest comprehensive backend test (Chat 199) shows a  and , with  (Chat 176) and . While this indicates significant improvements, it also highlights that 11 API modules are still failing and 32 random data instances persist.

The current work is immediately focused on resolving these remaining random data calls and fixing the identified failing API modules by completing their service implementations with real data and external API integrations.
