The previous AI engineer successfully established a Laravel 11 application, addressing initial environment issues and foundational UI. The project progressed from 23.7% to 42% completion through systematic implementation of core backend features: Website Builder, Escrow, Advanced Booking, Financial Management, and AI integration. A critical  to  middleware issue was resolved. The Escrow and Advanced Booking systems were fully implemented and tested, including database schema and model relationship fixes. Subsequently, the Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace were scaffolded. The user explicitly shifted the frontend requirement from React to Laravel Blade and emphasized achieving 100% completion, with all configurations managed via an admin dashboard. The immediate preceding task was an extensive audit of the existing codebase, initiated due to user insistence, to precisely identify implemented features and remaining gaps. The last known technical issue was controllers incorrectly using  instead of .

The Mewayz platform is envisioned as an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution. It consolidates social media management, digital commerce, educational content, CRM, and marketing automation. Key features include a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and feature-based subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise tiers with varying feature limits and pricing). Authentication will support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, and future biometric options. Core functionalities cover Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, and Analytics, all managed via an extensive Admin Dashboard. The platform must be mobile-optimized (PWA with Flutter web loader), built on Laravel with MySQL (originally suggested Supabase, but confirmed MySQL), and all data persisted in the database, with no hardcoding. The user emphasized that all environment variables, API keys, and database configurations should be visually managed through the admin dashboard. The overall goal is 100% feature completion within the Laravel/MySQL stack.

The codebase is a Laravel application.


-   : Contains API endpoints for various features like , , , , and . These are crucial for backend functionality.
-   : This custom middleware was implemented to resolve a critical authentication issue, replacing the default  in API routes for secure access to features.
-   : Laravel Eloquent models representing database tables. Many new models like , , , , and  were created to support new feature data structures.
-   : Defines the database schema. Numerous new migrations were added for Escrow, Booking, Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace, along with updates to existing tables (, ) to add necessary columns. Foreign key consistency was a notable challenge and was addressed.
-   : These Blade files define the frontend UI.  and  are important for the workspace setup wizard and the main dashboard view. The extensive audit is currently examining all these files.
-    and : These files define the application's routes.  was modified to include routes for new API controllers and integrate the  middleware.  handles web-based routes, including those for the workspace setup wizard.

<current_work>
The Laravel 11 application features a robust backend with MariaDB. Initial UI styling and basic dashboard views are established. A major authentication hurdle, switching from  to  middleware, has been successfully resolved across relevant API routes. The Escrow System and Advanced Booking System are fully implemented and verified on the backend, involving new models, migrations, and foreign key fixes.

Most recently, the previous AI engineer focused on addressing critical missing features identified during a comprehensive audit (which showed 42% completion). This included establishing the backend infrastructure for the Multi-workspace System (workspace setup, features, goals, subscription plans, team invitations), creating relevant migrations, and a . Frontend Blade views for this system (, ) and corresponding web routes have been created. Database issues related to missing  and  columns in the  table were identified and fixed.

Furthermore, the Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace features have been scaffolded on the backend, encompassing controllers, models, and necessary migrations. Corresponding API routes were added. The immediate current state is that a comprehensive backend test of these newly implemented systems revealed a common authentication failure: controllers are incorrectly using  instead of  to retrieve the authenticated user. The user also explicitly requested a full audit of all controllers, blades, models, and routes, which the previous engineer was in the process of conducting by examining various view files.
