The AI engineer's work on the Mewayz platform has progressed through several distinct and significant phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the Laravel environment, resolving critical PHP/MariaDB dependencies, fixing Stripe integration, and rebranding from ZEPH to Mewayz. This involved a major frontend redesign to a modern dark theme and an extensive console to dashboard renaming across routes, views, and directories. After successfully migrating all Python/FastAPI components to a pure Laravel PHP solution and comprehensive architectural reorganization, numerous environment, database, and constant definition issues were meticulously resolved to achieve production readiness. Subsequently, the user requested a full, highly professional frontend rebuild with specific dark theme aesthetics. This involved stripping all user-facing files and systematically recreating the entire frontend with Laravel Blade, Tailwind CSS, and Alpine.js, ensuring perfect visual fidelity and authentication flow. The current phase involves expanding the newly built dashboard with additional business features, creating new Blade templates for each.

The Mewayz platform aims to be a comprehensive Laravel-based business solution. The initial scope involved stabilizing the application post-Flutter frontend removal, addressing core functionalities, asset compilation, and API endpoints. The broader product vision includes a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic pricing, Instagram Management (accounts, scheduling, analytics, hashtags), AI-powered community features, an Admin dashboard, a public landing page, and an ElasticMail-driven partnership system. Future plans encompass creator mediakit, wallet, booking, invoice/financial management, and team collaboration. Immediate objectives prioritized consistent Mewayz branding, resolving all bugs (especially frontend authentication), and a complete frontend redesign to a modern dark theme, ensuring all existing and planned features are professionally presented and fully functional through the new dashboard, including interactive components. The latest user instruction explicitly requested the dashboard to be expanded with all necessary blades and made ultra professional and complete with all blades connected, very user-friendly, and no missing files.
