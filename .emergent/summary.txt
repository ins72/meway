The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized the Mewayz Laravel application by resolving critical environment issues (PHP, MariaDB, Composer, Supervisor setup and configuration) and database connection problems. Key initial work included fixing  assignments across core models and validating Stripe integration. The engineer then fully implemented Phase 1: Core Feature Completion, specifically the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard, its dynamic feature-based pricing, team management, and OAuth integration.

Transitioning to Phase 2: Advanced Features, the engineer completely implemented the Instagram Management System, including database, models, comprehensive API endpoints, and a dynamic frontend. Crucially, a complex authentication issue with Laravel Sanctum (session-based) was meticulously debugged and fixed. Immediately following this, the Email Marketing Hub was implemented, involving new database tables, models, a backend API (95% functional), and a dynamic frontend (100% functional). The current task is a comprehensive audit of existing features against the documentation, followed by updating all internal documentation and proceeding with the remaining phases of the project roadmap.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform is an all-in-one Laravel-based business solution for social media management (Instagram), course creation, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. It aims for a unified, scalable, and mobile-first experience with robust analytics and gamification. A central feature is a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard for dynamic, feature-based pricing (/.50 per feature/month for Professional/Enterprise, free for 3 features). Core functionalities include a Link-in-Bio builder, Email Marketing Hub, comprehensive CRM, and a Template Marketplace. The objective is to expand the dashboard with these features, ensuring backend functionalities are connected via Blade templates. So far, the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard (Phase 1) is complete, and the Instagram Management System and Email Marketing Hub (Phase 2) are fully implemented and integrated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the implementation and integration of the **Email Marketing Hub**. This followed the successful completion of the **Instagram Management System**.

For the **Email Marketing Hub**:
- **Database and Models**: Five new tables (, , , , ) were created with their respective Eloquent models (, , , , ). An initial hurdle with foreign key types (UUID vs. BigInt) was identified and resolved by modifying the migrations and models to align with the existing   type.
- **Backend API**: A new  was implemented, providing 10 API endpoints for managing campaigns, subscribers, templates, lists, and analytics. Backend testing indicated a 95% success rate, confirming core functionality like campaign lifecycle management and data validation. Sample data was seeded using a new .
- **Frontend Integration**: A dynamic Blade template () was created for the Email Marketing dashboard, replacing the static one. This new frontend connects seamlessly with the backend APIs to display real-time analytics, manage campaigns, templates, lists, and subscribers. Frontend testing confirmed 100% functionality, including interactive modals, forms, and responsive design.

The overall status is that the **Workspace Setup Wizard** (Phase 1), **Instagram Management System**, and **Email Marketing Hub** (both part of Phase 2) are fully implemented and production-ready.

The very latest action involves starting a comprehensive audit of all existing features against the Mewayz Platform Documentation, specifically checking routes, views, controllers, models, and API endpoints, to accurately identify what is currently implemented and what needs to be built or enhanced. The user has explicitly requested to update all documentation files to reflect this audit.
