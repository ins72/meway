The AI engineer successfully transitioned the Mewayz platform from an initial state, addressing critical environment issues (PHP, MariaDB) and resolving numerous backend functionality bugs. Key achievements include re-establishing a stable Laravel environment, comprehensive validation and fixing of Stripe integration, and rectifying  assignment and type casting issues across various models (Course, Product, BioSite). A major highlight was the full implementation and verification of Phase 1: Core Feature Completion, encompassing the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic feature-based pricing, team management, and OAuth integration. The process involved extensive debugging, database migrations, model enhancements, and API controller development. Currently, the engineer has just begun Phase 2: Advanced Features Implementation, starting with the database and model setup for the Instagram Management System, demonstrating a systematic approach to expanding the application's capabilities as per the detailed product requirements.

The Mewayz platform is envisioned as an all-in-one Laravel-based business solution, integrating social media management (Instagram), course creation, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. Initial development focused on rebranding, a modern dark-theme frontend, and core authentication. The platform aims for a unified, scalable, and mobile-first experience with robust analytics and gamification. A key feature is a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard enabling dynamic, feature-based pricing (/.50 per feature/month for Professional/Enterprise plans, free for 3 features). Other crucial functionalities include a Link-in-Bio builder, Email Marketing Hub, comprehensive CRM, and a Template Marketplace. The current objective is to expand the dashboard with these user-friendly features, ensuring all backend functionalities are connected via Blade templates, systematically progressing through defined phases from core features to advanced capabilities.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 1: Core Feature Completion of the Mewayz platform. This phase involved implementing the foundational elements of the application's comprehensive feature set.

Specifically, the following key components were built and verified as 100% functional:
1.  **6-Step Workspace Setup Wizard**: This wizard allows users to select business goals, choose from 40 platform features, set up teams, select subscription plans, and configure branding. All 10 associated API endpoints (, , , , , , , ) are fully operational with excellent response times.
2.  **Feature-Based Pricing System**: The complex pricing model, with a Free Plan (up to 3 features), Professional Plan ( per feature/month), and Enterprise Plan (.50 per feature/month), has been accurately implemented and dynamically calculates costs.
3.  **Team Management System**: A robust invitation system, including proper UUID and secure token generation, email validation, and role assignment, is now functional.
4.  **OAuth Integration (Google, Apple)**: The authentication system was enhanced to automatically create a workspace upon successful OAuth login, streamlining the user onboarding.
5.  **Template Marketplace Foundation**: The basic data structure for template categories (6 categories) and sample templates has been established, along with relevant models and seeders.

Critical fixes were also implemented during this phase, including resolving validation issues in pricing calculations, fixing team invitation token generation, and comprehensive database seeding for all new components. The backend architecture now includes 42 migration files and new Eloquent models supporting these features.

The very latest action involves starting Phase 2: Advanced Features Implementation, with the initial step being the creation of the database structure and Eloquent models for the **Instagram Management System**. This includes tables and models for , , , , and . The engineer is currently in the process of running these new migrations.
