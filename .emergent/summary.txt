The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative and determined effort to get the Mewayz application deployed and functional. Initially, work focused on core feature development, particularly completing the Plan Change Impact Analysis system and building new admin features like Workspace Subscription Management and Customer Notification. This involved extensive Python (FastAPI) backend development and React frontend integration for an admin dashboard.

However, the primary challenge became persistent production deployment failures (503 errors, container timeouts) in a Kubernetes environment. The engineer systematically debugged these, shifting from backend import issues and MongoDB Atlas connectivity to progressively simplifying the backend code (creating multiple minimal versions of ), fixing frontend build warnings, and refining supervisor configurations. Despite multiple guaranteed fixes, the deployment failures persisted, indicating deeply rooted environment or configuration challenges outside direct application logic, culminating in an extremely stripped-down backend to isolate the root cause.

The Mewayz Platform v2 is a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI capabilities, designed as an all-in-one business management solution. It features a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, MFA, and a post-registration setup wizard. Core functionalities include social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also critical. All data is persistently stored in MongoDB, optimized for mobile, and offers a native-app-like user experience.

Recent development established a robust backend for 13 major systems, including an Admin Plan Management system. Frontend work involved rebuilding the dashboard UI/UX, responsive fixes, and a multi-step onboarding wizard. Key implementations included Google OAuth authentication, live Stripe payment processing into the onboarding wizard, and significant efforts to fix persistent deployment failures preventing production launch with MongoDB Atlas.

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (PyMongo, AsyncIOMotor), JWT, Stripe API, Supervisor.
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, CSS, Google OAuth, Stripe.js, ,  package.
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (deployment environment), Environment Variables, CORS.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The backend is structured modularly with  for fundamental components,  for business logic,  for endpoints, and  for data schemas. The frontend  directory contains , , , , and .

**Directory Structure (Simplified relevant parts):**


**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Central FastAPI application. Initially updated to include  and  routers, robust lifespan event handling, and resilient  endpoint. *Throughout deployment debugging, it was progressively stripped down to extremely minimal versions (replaced by , , , ) to isolate startup issues, currently pointing to *.
-   : Modified to strictly fetch  from environment variables for production compatibility. During deployment fixes, connection logic was simplified to prevent blocking startup.
-    & : These files were extensively debugged and fixed to improve validation, error handling, and ensure correct database operations for the Plan Change Impact Analysis system.
-    (NEW) &  (NEW): Created to manage admin overrides, subscriptions, discounts, and complimentary accounts.
-    (NEW) &  (NEW): Created to handle multi-channel notifications for plan changes and admin actions.
-    (NEW) &  (NEW): Created to provide a modern, responsive interface for the newly implemented admin features, replacing the existing .
-   : Updated multiple times to include , , , and critically,  and other peer dependencies to resolve persistent frontend build warnings.  package was added for production frontend serving.
-   : Initially configured to start both frontend and backend. *Significantly modified during deployment debugging*: removed local MongoDB startup, added  for frontend, and later configured to use a  script, then simplified again to directly point to  and .
-   : Periodically updated with new Python dependencies and later stripped down to minimal (, ) during deployment debugging.

<pending_tasks>
- User is yet to provide the Stripe Webhook Signing Secret () for complete webhook processing.
- Implement comprehensive payment management beyond basic setup, including saving payment methods, handling failures, and redirecting to workspace.
- Complete remaining implementation for  service/API if any issues re-emerge after re-integrating the full application logic.
- Re-integrate the newly developed Admin Workspace Subscription Management and Customer Notification System and Advanced Admin Analytics features into the backend (they were temporarily removed for deployment debugging).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a deep and persistent battle to resolve critical deployment failures of the Mewayz application. Despite numerous attempts to fix 503 Service Unavailable errors and container timeouts in a Kubernetes environment, the issue persisted.

The engineer's strategy evolved to an ultra-minimal, bulletproof approach for both backend and deployment configuration:
1.  **Backend Simplification**: The original  (with all its routers and database connections) was replaced with increasingly stripped-down versions (, , , and finally ). The current  is an extremely barebones FastAPI application (approx. 73 lines) with minimal, direct health endpoints (, , , , , ) and placeholders for  and , along with a catch-all route. It has virtually no dependencies, no complex database logic, and no original application routers (e.g., admin features, Stripe, social media).
2.  **Frontend Build Fixes**: Missing  and other peer dependencies were added to  to resolve warnings during the frontend build process. The  package was also added to  for serving the static frontend in production.
3.  **Supervisor Configuration Streamlining**: The  file was modified multiple times. Initially, it was trying to run local MongoDB, which was removed. It was then configured to start the  backend and use  for the frontend. Custom startup scripts () were introduced and then removed, reverting to a direct supervisord command execution.
4.  **Dependency Minimization**: The  for the backend was reduced to only  and .

The immediate goal was to achieve a successful Kubernetes deployment, even if it meant deploying a non-functional, ultra-minimal version of the app, to pinpoint whether the issue was application logic or environment/container startup. The trajectory ends with the engineer having just replaced the main backend file with , having simplified , and having added a static  as a frontend fallback, then restarting supervisor. The 503 errors and container timeouts are still being reported by the user, indicating the core deployment problem remains unresolved at the end of the provided trajectory.

<optional_next_step>
Restart supervisor and re-verify that the ultra-simple backend and frontend are running correctly after the last  change.
