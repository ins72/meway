The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and significantly enhanced the Mewayz application, transforming it from an MVP into an enterprise-grade platform. Initial efforts focused on resolving critical frontend and backend issues, including persistent Flutter PWA problems and a redundant FastAPI setup, which was eventually removed for a streamlined Laravel-only architecture. A major undertaking involved a comprehensive branding update to Mewayz and generating extensive documentation. Following user feedback, the focus shifted to feature enhancement, specifically the Instagram Intelligence Engine, Bio Site Builder, CRM, and Social Media Management. The engineer methodically implemented advanced features like AI capabilities, A/B testing, and automation, iteratively testing and refining each component. The most recent task initiated by the user is a detailed file-by-file review to generate a comprehensive rapport on the project's current scope and functionality.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project aims to deliver an enterprise-grade, cloud-native, all-in-one business platform. This encompasses social media management, digital commerce, education, CRM, marketing automation, website building, booking, template marketplaces, escrow, and financial management. The architecture is built on a Laravel 10+ backend with MySQL 8.0+ and a Flutter 3.x frontend for mobile/desktop. Key non-functional requirements include high performance (sub-200ms API, sub-3s page loads, 10,000+ concurrent users, 99.9% uptime) and stringent security (AES-256, TLS 1.3, SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, RBAC). The user explicitly requested professional, in-depth documentation, consistent branding (Mewayz by Mewayz Technologies Inc., Seamless philosophy), and resolution of all initial frontend and backend errors. Core features implemented so far include PWA architecture, a professional authentication system (OAuth 2.0, SSO, 2FA, biometrics), multi-workspace management, and foundational social media, CRM, E-commerce, and Link in Bio functionalities. Future enhancements are guided by a detailed 15-section product specification.

<code_architecture>
The Mewayz application utilizes a Laravel backend for its API services and web pages, complemented by a Flutter application for mobile and web client experiences. The overall architecture was simplified by removing a redundant FastAPI layer, with Laravel now directly handling all backend operations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant phase of transforming Mewayz MVP features into enterprise-grade, professional implementations. This involved:

1.  **System Stabilization**: Initial work included debugging backend (PHP, Composer, MariaDB) and frontend (Flutter PWA) issues, ensuring the application was operational. The problematic FastAPI backend was entirely removed, simplifying the architecture to a direct Laravel backend serving on port 8001, which was a major refactor.
2.  **Branding & Documentation**: A comprehensive branding update changed all instances from Zeph to Mewayz and Mewayz Technologies Inc. across the codebase and documentation. An extensive suite of professional documentation (e.g., , , ) was generated.
3.  **Core Feature Enhancement (First Wave)**:
    *   **Instagram Intelligence Engine**: Implemented professional OAuth, competitor analysis, hashtag tracking, user analytics, AI content suggestions, and token refresh.
    *   **Enhanced Bio Site Builder**: Added professional themes, advanced customization (CSS/JS), SEO optimization, email capture, booking forms, QR code generation, and professional analytics.
    *   **Advanced CRM System**: Enhanced contact management with validation, custom fields, marketing consent, deal management, and summary analytics.
    *   **Professional Social Media Management**: Expanded multi-platform support, advanced analytics, content optimization, scheduling, performance tracking, and campaign management.
    All these enhancements were tested and reported 100% success rates.
4.  **Core Feature Enhancement (Second Wave - Adding More Depth)**: Upon user request for more depth, the AI engineer further integrated advanced AI capabilities, A/B testing, and automation into the previously enhanced features:
    *   **Instagram Intelligence Engine**: Added content performance prediction, audience intelligence, sentiment analysis, hashtag intelligence, and predictive analytics.
    *   **Bio Site Builder**: Integrated A/B testing with automated winner selection, predictive analytics, conversion tracking, a full monetization platform, and advanced customization.
    *   **CRM System**: Incorporated complex multi-step automation workflows, AI lead scoring, advanced pipeline management, predictive analytics, and smart recommendations.
    *   **Social Media Management**: Further refined content optimization, cross-platform insights, intelligent scheduling, and advanced campaign management.
    Minor fixes for Log facade and Instagram route configuration were also completed during this phase.

The immediate current work, initiated by the user's latest explicit request, is to conduct a comprehensive file-by-file review of the entire project to understand its current scope, functionality (backend/frontend breakdown), and implementation details. The aim is to generate a  file summarizing this information for future reference. The AI engineer has started this process by exploring directory structures.
