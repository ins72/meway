The previous AI engineer's primary objective was to achieve full feature parity with an extensive Laravel-based documentation onto an existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. A recurring challenge was ensuring absolute verification of all features and a thorough overhaul of documentation, including removing Laravel-specific content. The engineer focused on both frontend and backend. Frontend enhancements included creating numerous new pages and addressing persistent rendering issues, sometimes by deploying simpler placeholder versions. On the backend, a critical JWT authentication duplication was centralized in , significantly improving backend test success. The engineer also integrated Google OAuth, Stripe payments, X (Twitter), TikTok, and ElasticMail APIs. The work is now focused on frontend review, adding missing components, and confirming comprehensive feature implementation against the detailed documentation, with a stated 95%+ feature coverage and ongoing enhancements.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution aiming to re-implement all features from an extensive Laravel-based documentation into its current FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. Key features include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise) with feature-based pricing (/feature/month, 0/year; .5/feature/month, 5/year for premium), and a multi-step onboarding wizard for workspace setup (with 6 main goals: Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, plus one to be decided).

Authentication requires Google, Apple, and Email login, with secure Stripe payment integration (webhooks, saved payment methods). Comprehensive business tools encompass Instagram management (filtering, AI recommendations, content analysis), Drag & Drop Link in Bio builder (custom domains, analytics), CRM & Email Marketing (contact management, automated workflows, ElasticMail integration), Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, escrow), Analytics (with gamification), Course & Community System, and a Template Marketplace (user-generated, sellable). An extensive admin dashboard for platform control is mandated, alongside unified analytics. All visible data must be stored in MongoDB, optimized for Flutter web loader and mobile apps, avoiding hardcoding and using mock data for population. Documentation must be updated to v3.0.0 and July 20.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup within , with  for FastAPI and  for React.



-   : Manages React routing and application context. Modified extensively to include new routes for , ,  (later replaced by simple versions), , , , , , , and . It was also updated to wrap the entire application with  for Google login functionality and fix related linting issues.
-   : The core FastAPI entry point. This file was critically updated to centralize JWT authentication functions (, ), resolve circular import issues, and ensure consistent authentication. It was further enhanced to initialize  for Google OAuth, define OAuth-related Pydantic models, and add Google OAuth callback routes (, ). Stripe initialization and subscription-related Pydantic models (, ) and their corresponding API routes were also added. It now imports and includes routes from .
-   : A newly created file that encapsulates the backend logic for X (Twitter), TikTok, and ElasticMail integrations, including API endpoints for posting to X, interacting with TikTok, and sending emails via ElasticMail. It imports and uses API keys from the  file.
-   : The login interface. Modified to integrate Google OAuth, allowing users to sign in using their Google accounts through a functional  component, replacing a static button.
-   : The registration interface. Similar to , this file was updated to include functional Google OAuth registration, replacing the static Google sign-up button.
-   : Frontend environment variables. Updated to include  for the Google OAuth integration.
-   : Backend environment variables. Updated to include , , , , , , , ,  for the new integrations.
-   : Enhanced to include advanced filtering, AI recommendations, and content analysis features. Syntax errors and duplicate data/function declarations were fixed.
-   : Newly created for a comprehensive template marketplace.
-   : Enhanced with advanced multi-platform scheduling features.
-    and :  was created for advanced analytics but replaced by a simpler  due to rendering errors.
-    and :  was created but replaced by  due to rendering issues.
-   : Newly created multi-step onboarding wizard.
-   : Newly created for workspace invitations.
-   : Newly created to manage subscription tiers.
-   : Newly created to implement drag & drop Link in Bio functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in a comprehensive enhancement phase for the Mewayz platform, adding advanced pages and improving existing ones to match the detailed documentation.

On the **backend**, critical integrations were a focus. The engineer successfully implemented:
*   **Google OAuth:** Centralizing authentication logic, installing , defining models, and adding  and  routes in .
*   **Stripe Payments:** Installing , initializing Stripe with API keys, defining subscription-related models (, ), and adding corresponding API routes in  to support a 3-tier pricing model.
*   **Social Media and Email Integrations:** Installing  (ElasticMail was not found via pip, API key was provided), creating  to handle X (Twitter), TikTok, and ElasticMail APIs, and exposing these functionalities via new endpoints in .

On the **frontend**, the engineer focused on integrating these new backend features and enhancing the UI:
*   **Google OAuth:**  was installed.  was updated to wrap the application with  using the client ID from . Both  and  were modified to use the  component, integrating the new OAuth handlers for seamless login/registration.
*   **New Pages/Components:** , , , , and  were created and their routes added to .
*   **Documentation:**  was created, and  was updated.

The work concluded with backend integration tests showing an **80% success rate**, confirming Google OAuth, Stripe, X, TikTok, and ElasticMail integrations were largely functional. Frontend screenshots confirmed the visual integration of Google OAuth buttons and the new enhanced social media manager page. The user then reiterated a broad request to review my frontend, add any missing files/pages and improve where possible to get the most professional result, emphasizing full feature confirmation against the extensive documentation. The AI's last action was to continue creating new critical frontend components and adding them to the routing.
