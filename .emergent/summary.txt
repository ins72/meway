The previous AI engineer meticulously migrated features from a monolithic Python script () to a modular FastAPI and React application. This involved an iterative wave approach, creating dedicated API () and service () modules for each feature, integrating them into , and rigorously testing. A significant part of the work focused on the systematic, aggressive removal of migrated code from the  file to ensure it only contained unimplemented features. After successfully migrating numerous features, including Webhooks, Monitoring, Backup, and Compliance systems, the platform reached a 100% completion state from the old backup. The recent work shifted to auditing and professionalizing the project structure, including ensuring a one-to-one mapping between API routes and their corresponding service logic, identifying and creating missing service files.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is conceived as a mobile-first PWA business solution, built on FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, designed for extensive feature expandability. Its core functionalities include multi-workspace support, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, tiered Stripe subscriptions, Google/Email authentication, and a multi-step onboarding process. Key feature sets encompass Instagram management, a Link in Bio builder, CRM, Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and an AI/Automation suite with an integrated token economy, all managed via an Admin Dashboard. The platform must adhere to specific technical constraints: exclusive use of MongoDB, mobile optimization, dark theme support, and avoidance of hardcoded data for scalability. Current development imperatives focus on transitioning from mock data to real database interactions, enhancing user experience (UX), retention, and conversion rates, establishing a robust and maintainable code structure, and completely eradicating legacy Laravel components. The previous development phase was dedicated to systematically migrating existing features from a monolithic structure to a modular, scalable architecture.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture, organized within the  directory.



- : The central FastAPI application entry point. It dynamically imports and includes  instances from the  directory.
    - **Changes**: This file has been continually updated to register new API modules as features were migrated. Recent integrations include , , , and . It also underwent a professional audit where  was created to serve as the new cleaned .
- : Served as the monolithic source for features to be migrated.
    - **Changes**: This file has been aggressively cleaned multiple times. All features confirmed as migrated and working in the modular structure (initially 46, then Webhook, Monitoring, Backup, Compliance) have been systematically removed. The file now indicates 100% PLATFORM COMPLETION, suggesting all identified features from this backup have been migrated.
- : Contains FastAPI  modules, each defining API routes for specific features.
    - **Changes**: New files like , , ,  were created. The latest task involves ensuring a corresponding service file exists for each API router, leading to potential creation of missing API files like  or  or  if they were previously consolidated or missing explicit files.
- : Houses the business logic, encapsulating operations for each feature and interacting with the database.
    - **Changes**: New files like , , ,  were created. The most recent task involved identifying and creating numerous missing service files (e.g., , , , , , , etc.) to ensure a one-to-one mapping with the  modules.
- : Logs testing outcomes and migration progress for each feature wave.
    - **Changes**: Regularly updated with summaries of completed feature waves (e.g., Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Twentieth) detailing success rates and fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a comprehensive audit and restructuring phase, specifically focusing on ensuring a perfect mapping between API modules in  and their corresponding service modules in .

This task was initiated following the user's request: make sure that for all api i have all services and vice versa.

The steps taken include:
1.  **Auditing File Counts**: Initially, the agent compared the number of files in the  directory (52 files) against the  directory (29 files), immediately indicating a significant discrepancy and missing service modules.
2.  **Automated Audit Script**: A new Python script, , was created. This script was designed to:
    *   List all Python files in the  directory.
    *   Derive the expected service file name for each API file (e.g.,  in  expects  in ).
    *   Check for the existence of these expected service files.
    *   Report missing service files and suggest their creation.
3.  **Creation of Missing Service Files**: Based on the audit report from , the AI engineer began systematically creating the identified missing service files. Multiple batches of files were created, for example:
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   
    *   

The work is currently in progress, with the AI engineer continuing to create the remaining service files identified by the audit script. The backend server was restarted after each batch of file creations to apply changes.
