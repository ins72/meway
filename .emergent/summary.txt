The previous AI engineer focused on transforming Mewayz v2 from an MVP to production-readiness. The process was iterative, primarily resolving severe backend regressions, syntax errors, and router registration issues in a FastAPI-MongoDB application. Key challenges included database connectivity mismatches (sync/async), missing service getter functions, persistent syntax errors in services, incorrect MongoDB truth value checks, and critical authentication/authorization flaws (401/403 errors, incorrect API dependencies). The engineer systematically addressed these using custom fixer scripts, successfully establishing database connectivity, authentication (JWT), and basic CRUD operations for financial data. Missing API/service pairs and integrations for Twitter/X, TikTok, and Stripe were implemented. Despite significant progress, the final tests indicated an overall success rate of 75.4%, with remaining critical authentication middleware issues and incomplete service layer implementations preventing full production readiness. The engineer's approach involved continuous debugging, targeted fixes, and re-testing, gradually improving the system's stability and feature completeness. The user's initial mention of MySQL was superseded by the continued use and stabilization of MongoDB.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is a mobile-first PWA aiming to be a comprehensive business tool with over 15 AI-powered features. It requires a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, multi-factor authentication, and a post-registration setup wizard covering Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, and CRM. Core functionalities include social media management (Instagram API, advanced filtering, posting/scheduling), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, full CRM/Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, payments, escrow), unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite with a token economy, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also required. All data must be persistently stored (currently MongoDB, though MySQL was a stated preference), strictly avoiding hardcoded/mock data, ensuring full CRUD across all components. The platform mandates mobile optimization (Flutter web loader), dark theme, seamless integration for expansion, and a native-app-like user experience.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend.


-   : Primary FastAPI entry point.
    -   **Importance**: Initializes app, sets event handlers, dynamically includes API routers.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously modified to fix router inclusion logic, database lifespan functions, and to add new API routers (e.g., website builder, referral system, social media management, stats endpoints).
-   : Manages MongoDB connection.
    -   **Importance**: Critical for data persistence.
    -   **Changes**: Debugged for connection initialization and ensuring async database access.
-   : Handles authentication and security.
    -   **Importance**: Central for user authentication, token generation, and RBAC.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to use async database operations, fix admin access checks, and resolve database connection timing issues in middleware.
-   : Business logic for features.
    -   **Importance**: Implement core application logic.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive fixes for  (indentation, unmatched parentheses),  for missing services/functions,  method implementation, proper async/await handling for MongoDB operations, and general cleanup of duplicated/malformed code. New services like  and  were created.
-   : Define API endpoints.
    -   **Importance**: Expose application functionality via HTTP.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed , duplicate parameters,  issues, and crucially, updated dependencies from  to  for proper authorization. New APIs for social media, referral system, TikTok, Twitter, and Stripe integrations were added.
-   : Stores testing protocols and results.
    -   **Importance**: Central for tracking progress and issues.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously read and updated to reflect backend test outcomes.
-    (e.g., , , , ): Ad-hoc Python scripts.
    -   **Importance**: Used for large-scale code analysis, generation, refactoring, and automated fixes across many files. Many were created throughout the trajectory to systematically resolve recurring issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of  and , ,  API integration endpoints beyond health checks.
-   Address remaining critical authentication middleware issues causing 403 Forbidden errors despite valid JWT tokens.
-   Ensure full CRUD operations are robust and implemented across ALL remaining endpoints, fixing any 405 Method Not Allowed errors.
-   Thoroughly audit and eliminate any residual mock, random, or hardcoded data for all endpoints.
-   Address any missing service/API pairs that might still exist after recent additions.
-   Achieve the target of 95%+ overall success rate in comprehensive tests.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a continuous loop of fix all requests to achieve production release readiness. The primary focus has been on resolving a persistent critical authentication middleware issue, where valid JWT tokens are not properly validated by protected endpoints, leading to 403 Forbidden errors.

The engineer recently:
1.  Implemented  (Chat Message 364) to apply comprehensive fixes.
2.  Updated  to register new API testing endpoints and integrate recent changes.
3.  Created  (Chat Message 374) to address 405 Method Not Allowed errors, aiming to enable all CRUD operations.
4.  Added missing API endpoints for TikTok, Twitter/X, and Stripe integrations, as these were identified as incomplete during prior tests (Chat Message 377-382).
5.  Restarted the backend and ran a final comprehensive test (Chat Message 388), which indicated a **75.4% overall success rate**. While significant progress was made (authentication system working, infrastructure solid, services operational), the critical authentication middleware issue persisted, preventing the achievement of the 95%+ target.

The user's last explicit instruction (Chat Message 391) was to fix all make full crud make all missing files make all real data etc. The AI engineer confirmed this in Chat Message 392, stating the plan is to systematically fix ALL remaining issues to achieve 95%+ production readiness, starting with the critical authentication middleware problem. The system is functional at a foundational level, but requires further refinement for full production deployment as per the explicit user requirements for 100% real data and comprehensive CRUD.
