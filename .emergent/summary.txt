The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Mewayz platform from an MVP to a more functional state by integrating real data and external APIs, eliminating mock data. Initial progress focused on core features like social media lead generation, AI automation, and email marketing, followed by the complete implementation of a Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard and Link in Bio Builder, both with full CRUD and real data. A subsequent platform audit identified numerous missing features. The current directives, heavily influenced by a detailed user specification, shift the development strategy to implementing *all remaining features* (including newly requested ones like Referral/Affiliate System) systematically and *without intermediate testing*, with a single, comprehensive test phase after all features are production-ready. The AI engineer is currently in the midst of this bulk implementation, having started or created files for the E-commerce System (completing it), Course & Community Platform, Escrow System, Financial Management, Referral System, Advanced Admin Dashboard, and Website Builder, with the intention to update  once all features are complete. A key architectural decision is the modular backend structure (FastAPI, Services, APIs, Core), interacting with MongoDB, while a recurring user request for MySQL persistence contradicts the established MongoDB backend and the no tech stack change directive.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as a mobile-first PWA, utilizing FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, integrating over 15 business tools into an AI-powered ecosystem. It necessitates multi-workspace support with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, and multi-factor authentication (Google, Apple, Email, Stripe). Core functionalities include comprehensive social media management (with lead generation, advanced filtering, and CSV export), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder with custom domains, a full CRM/Email Marketing suite, a Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite with a token economy and an extensive Admin Dashboard are also required. Critical mandates include exclusive MongoDB usage, mobile optimization, dark theme, and strict avoidance of hardcoded or mock data, requiring all visible information to be persisted in MongoDB or fetched from external APIs with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities. The current focus is on filling identified feature gaps, specifically a multi-process workspace setup wizard (with 6 main goals, team roles, and tiered subscriptions) and the extensive admin dashboard, along with implementing a new URL/code-based referral/affiliate system. The platform must be seamlessly expandable for future features, with all visible data persisted in the database.

<pending_tasks>
The following major features are pending implementation, requiring full CRUD and real data integration:
- Multi-Workspace System with RBAC (core logic for creation, invitations, roles)
- Subscription Management (3-tier pricing, Stripe integration, limits)
- Booking System for appointments
- Template Marketplace (creation, selling, usage for various templates)
- Team Management & Invitations
- Unified Analytics with Gamification
- Mobile PWA Features (optimization, push notifications, offline capabilities)
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a systematic implementation phase of remaining Mewayz platform features. This follows a user directive to implement all missing functionalities, including new requests, with real data and full CRUD capabilities, postponing all testing until *after* all features are implemented.

The work began by addressing the E-commerce System ( and ). While these files pre-existed, the engineer identified and appended significant missing logic to the service file, ensuring comprehensive product, order, and store management capabilities.

Following this, the engineer proceeded with the systematic creation of new backend service and API files for other critical features:
1.  **Instagram Integration**:  and  were created to handle Instagram data and lead generation.
2.  **Course & Community Platform (Skool-like)**:  and  were created.
3.  **Escrow System**:  and  were created.
4.  **Financial Management System**:  was created.
5.  **Referral/Affiliate System**:  and  were created. A minor linting issue was encountered but the API file was created.
6.  **Advanced Admin Dashboard**:  and  were created.
7.  **Website Builder**:  was created.

Throughout this process,  was updated to include the routers for Instagram, E-commerce, Course & Community, and Escrow, ensuring these new endpoints are exposed. The engineer's last stated intention is to finish implementing the remaining critical features and then update the main.py to include all the new routers. This indicates the process of systematically creating the backend service and API files for all pending features is ongoing.
