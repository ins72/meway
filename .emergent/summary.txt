The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz platform from a mock-data-ridden, monolithic structure to a professional, modular FastAPI and React application with real MongoDB integration. The initial phase focused on building a robust, dependency-injected architecture. Subsequently, the engineer systematically migrated core and high-value features from the legacy  (which was a copy of ) into the new modular  and  directories. Crucially, each migration wave involved identifying valuable features, implementing them with real data, integrating them, testing for functionality, and then removing the successfully migrated code from the old monolithic file. This iterative process, guided by explicit user feedback to keep removing and migrating more, has significantly enhanced the platform's functionality, including subscription management, Google OAuth, financial systems, analytics, team management, form builder, promotions, AI token management, and course management. The work halted while integrating CRM and Website Builder.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA business solution, re-implemented using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, intended for extensive feature expansion. Key functionalities include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, tiered subscriptions (Free, Pro, Enterprise) via Stripe, Google/Email authentication, and a dynamic multi-step onboarding wizard. Features dynamically adjust based on user goals (Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, AI-decided). The platform offers Instagram management, a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM & Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and AI/Automation with a token ecosystem, all managed via a robust Admin Dashboard. Data must be in MongoDB, optimized for mobile, with a dark theme, and no hardcoded data for seamless expansion. Initial requests for 10,000+ features and 200+ API endpoints prioritized user-friendliness, deep integration, subscription handling, AI auto-blogging, live chat, globalization, and marketing. Recent efforts critically shifted to eliminate mock data, ensure real database interaction, improve UX, retention, and conversion, establish a maintainable code structure, and remove all Laravel remnants.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture rooted in the  directory.



-   : This file has become the primary entry point for the refactored FastAPI application. It now orchestrates the inclusion of various  instances from the modular  directory, replacing the old monolithic .
-   : A backup of the original 26,296-line monolithic . This file, along with its copy , serves as the source from which features are systematically migrated to the new modular structure. Successfully migrated features are then removed from this file.
-   : A direct copy of , used as the working source for identifying and removing implemented features as per user's explicit request.
-   : Manages MongoDB connections and collection getters. It has been modified to use lazy initialization, crucial for real data operations.
-   : This directory has been significantly expanded with new service files (e.g., , , , ) to encapsulate business logic for new API modules, adhering to dependency injection principles and ensuring real MongoDB operations.
-   : This directory is the core of the new modular architecture, housing separate modules for distinct API routes. Numerous new files like , , , , , , , , , , , and  have been created. These new modules systematically migrate and implement features from the old monolithic file, ensuring real database connectivity and professional structure.
-   : Continuously updated by the AI engineer and testing agents, it tracks audit findings, testing protocols, and successful/failed migrations, serving as a critical communication and progress log.

<pending_tasks>
-   Continue systematically adding more depth and features to the platform.
-   Identify and migrate valuable features/endpoints from  (which is a copy of ) to the new modular structure.
-   Ensure all newly added features are fully integrated, professional, and use real database interactions, without hardcoded or mock data.
-   Remove features from  only after they have been successfully migrated and confirmed working in the new structure.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the ongoing SYSTEMATIC FEATURE MIGRATION FROM MONOLITHIC FILE based on the user's explicit instruction to keep removing and migrating more.

The previous waves of migration successfully implemented:
-   **First Wave:** Subscription Management, Google OAuth, Financial Management, Analytics, and Link Shortener.
-   **Second Wave:** Team Management and Form Builder.
-   **Third Wave:** Promotions & Referrals.
-   **Fourth Wave:** AI Token Management and Course & Learning Management.
All these features were systematically migrated from  to their respective new modular API and service files (e.g., , , etc.), tested for functionality (achieving high success rates), and then explicitly removed from the  file as confirmed by the user's follow-up request.

The current focus, as explicitly directed by the user in Chat Message 157 (continue the systematic migration by identifying more valuable features to migrate. Let me look for Website Builder and CRM systems next), is on migrating the **Website Builder** and **CRM (Customer Relationship Management) systems**.

Specifically, the AI engineer has:
1.  Identified CRM and Website Builder functionalities within  (Chat Messages 158-161).
2.  Successfully created the new API module  (Chat Message 162).
3.  Attempted to create , encountered an import error (Chat Message 164), debugged and fixed it (Chat Messages 165-167).
4.  Successfully created the new API module  (Chat Message 168).
5.  At the very end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was in the process of adding both the newly created CRM and Website Builder API modules to the main application's entry point () (Chat Message 169).

The work is currently suspended right before confirming the successful integration of CRM and Website Builder modules into the main application.
