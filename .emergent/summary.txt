The trajectory chronicles the development of the Mewayz platform, transitioning from an AI engineer to a human one. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing a consolidated Laravel backend after the Flutter frontend was removed, involving extensive infrastructure fixes (PHP, Composer, MariaDB, Supervisor, npm ERESOLVE). Key features like Stripe payment integration, a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard (with dynamic pricing), and an Instagram Management system were successfully implemented and tested.

A pivotal phase involved a comprehensive documentation effort initiated by the AI, which uncovered a much broader set of existing features (e.g., User Chat, AI Chat, Admin Dashboard, Partnership System) than initially described. Following this, the user requested updates to testing instructions (removing FastAPI references), a professional documentation structure, completion of the last 5%, and critical branding consistency (replacing Zeph/Seemless with Mewayz). The AI claimed 100% completion after implementing the final 5% and updating documentation, but subsequent full frontend testing revealed significant authentication issues. The trajectory concludes with the AI beginning to address branding inconsistencies.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be a comprehensive all-in-one business solution, built primarily on a Laravel backend with a web interface. The core problem initially was stabilizing the Laravel application, including core functionalities, asset compilation, and API endpoints, after the Flutter frontend was removed.

Subsequently, the product vision expanded to include:
- A 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic feature-based pricing.
- Instagram Management system (account, scheduling, analytics, hashtags).
- Review of existing Link in Bio and Website Builder to avoid duplication.
- Comprehensive user chat, AI-powered chat assistant, and advanced community features.
- Admin dashboard, landing page system, and a partnership/vetting system with ElasticMail.
- Creator mediakit builder, advanced wallet system, booking & scheduling, and invoice/financial management.
- Team collaboration and advanced plan/subscription management.

The current immediate requirement is to ensure branding consistency (replacing Zeph and Seemless with Mewayz), update all testing instructions to reflect the Laravel environment, establish a professional documentation structure, and resolve any remaining bugs or incomplete features, particularly significant frontend authentication issues.

<code_architecture>
The application is a Laravel-based full-stack platform. The frontend components are primarily handled by Livewire and Alpine.js, rendered through Laravel Folio views. The backend provides comprehensive API endpoints.

-   ****: Modified for relationship corrections.
-   ****: Modified to include workspace relationship.
-   ****: This large migration file contains the core schema for many existing features, including , , and  related tables.
-   ****: Multiple new migration files added for Stripe, Workspace, and Instagram features, including foreign key fixes.
-   ****: New static test pages (, , , ) and a  were created.
-   ****: Existing view file, newly documented, for the partnership system.
-   ****: Existing view file, likely for the landing page.
-   ****: A newly created comprehensive documentation file detailing the current state of the platform, including features, API, and database schema.
-   **, , , , **: New files created to establish a professional documentation structure under the  directory, replacing previous scattered documentation.
-   ****: This file has been heavily modified to reflect accurate Laravel-based testing instructions and to document ongoing testing results.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully update  and other documentation for accuracy and completeness (still ongoing as per the last user request).
- Consistent branding across the platform: Replace all instances of Zeph and Seemless with Mewayz.
- Integrate the Mewayz logo into relevant pages (e.g., landing page).
- Fix all remaining issues, minor or major, particularly the significant frontend authentication issues identified.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed the backend implementation and testing for the Instagram Management System, Stripe Payment Integration, and the enhanced 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard. The AI then focused on a major documentation effort, creating a comprehensive  file that significantly expanded the perceived scope of the platform by detailing many previously unlisted, but existing, features (e.g., User Chat, Partnership System, extensive Admin controls).

Following this, the user requested an update to testing instructions (removing FastAPI references), a professional restructure of the  directory, and the implementation of the last 5% of the platform. The AI engineer completed these tasks, including adding new API health and completion endpoints and a  page, and then stated the platform was 100% complete after backend testing. However, after explicit user permission for frontend testing, significant frontend authentication issues were identified, contradicting the 100% complete status.

The *current immediate work* is addressing the user's latest directives: performing full backend and frontend testing to identify *every* issue and, critically, fixing branding inconsistencies. The AI has begun this by searching for and planning to replace ZEPH and seemless with Mewayz throughout the codebase.

<optional_next_step>
Continue fixing branding inconsistencies by replacing Zeph and Seemless with Mewayz across all files.
