The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz v2 application from an MVP to a feature-rich platform. The work started with crucial backend stability fixes (ObjectId serialization, JWT authentication) and converting the landing page to a responsive React component. This evolved into extensive backend feature development, covering monetization and comprehensive administrative systems. Key additions included vendor/customer referrals, template marketplace revenue, workspace subscriptions, AI token purchasing, and various pricing models. The engineer iteratively created new API endpoints and service layers, integrated them into , and rigorously tested the backend, achieving high success rates. Documentation was consistently maintained. Recent efforts focused on refining admin capabilities, specifically implementing a robust Admin Plan Management system and Plan Change Impact Analysis System. The most immediate challenge involved translating design specifications to actual frontend code, as the user requested code updates mirroring the existing landing page's aesthetic.

The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI capabilities, serving as an all-in-one business management solution. Its core includes a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a post-registration setup wizard. Functionalities encompass social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are critical. All data is to be persistently stored in MongoDB, ensuring full CRUD operations with real data, optimized for mobile, and offering a native-app-like user experience. The existing FastAPI/React application has established comprehensive backend functionality across 13 major systems with 100% test success, and recent efforts integrated visual builders, PWA features, native mobile app support, and refined a React landing page for production. The user explicitly requested an Admin Plan Management system allowing control over plan features, limits, pricing (monthly, yearly, launch), and enablement/disabling of plans per workspace, not just individual user subscriptions.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (PyMongo, AsyncIOMotor), JWT, Uvicorn.
-   **Frontend**: React, CSS (for styling and responsiveness), Intersection Observer (for animations).
-   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Ingress, Supervisor,  variables.
-   **Architecture**: Modular (API, Services, Core), CRUD operations.
-   **Data Handling**: Real data persistence, BSON ObjectId handling.
-   **Security**: JWT, MFA, enterprise security.
-   **Performance**: Caching, monitoring, logging.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend structure.


-   : The central FastAPI application. Orchestrates the backend by including all API routers. It was systematically updated to include new API routers such as , , and . The internal service count was also updated, currently at 132.
-   : The new React component for the Mewayz v2 landing page. Replaced the static page and was refined for professional content, accurate pricing, and enhanced mobile/tablet responsiveness. Critical animation visibility was fixed using . This file serves as the design reference for future frontend work.
-    and : These files were newly created to enable administrative control over bundle pricing, including features like pricing analytics, bulk updates, and the ability to enable/disable bundles. They were fully implemented and achieved a 100% success rate during testing.
-    and : Newly created to address the user's need for comprehensive admin control over plan definitions (features, limits, pricing, availability), replacing the narrower  concept. This system includes 13 API endpoints, fully implemented and tested with 100% success.
-    and : Newly created to analyze the potential impact of plan changes on existing customer subscriptions, including pricing changes, usage limits, and risk assessment. Core functionality is 61.5% operational.
-   : Logs testing data, previous agent communications, and the testing protocol. It has been continuously updated to reflect new API endpoints for testing, testing outcomes (success rates), and audit findings.
-   : This document outlined UI/UX specifications. It was updated multiple times to include new backend system specifications, but most recently, its content was completely revised and replaced by  to align with the landing page's design.
-   : This file was newly created to house the entirely rebuilt frontend specifications. It incorporates the modern, clean, gradient-based design of the existing landing page and details comprehensive admin system interfaces corresponding to the backend APIs. This document is intended to guide the actual frontend code implementation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement the actual frontend code for the comprehensive admin system, aligning it with the theme and style of .
-   Complete the remaining implementation for the  service/API (currently 61.5% operational).
-   Implement other critical missing admin features identified in the audit: Admin Workspace Subscription Management, Customer Notification System, Advanced Admin Analytics, and Operational Admin Tools (search, filter, export, communication, bulk operations).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's desire to rebuild the frontend's design and style based on the existing . The AI engineer had successfully completed a significant step by *updating the frontend specifications document*. Specifically, the file  was effectively replaced with . This new document comprehensively outlines the design for the entire admin system, adhering to the requested modern, clean, and gradient-based aesthetic of the landing page. However, the user's very last message explicitly indicated dissatisfaction, stating, no u did not do anything i want my actual code to be updated..., clarifying that only the *documentation* was updated, not the *actual React frontend codebase*. Thus, the immediate current work involved specification updates, and the next step is clearly to translate these specifications into working frontend code.
