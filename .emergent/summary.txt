The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz platform from a conceptual Laravel specification to a functional FastAPI/React/MongoDB application. The work focused on establishing a robust foundation including JWT authentication, Google OAuth, and Stripe integration. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to building a comprehensive AI token ecosystem and addressing critical frontend stability issues like icon import errors and React Hook violations. The engineer iteratively added and expanded core features such as Link Shortener, Instagram Lead Generation, Template Marketplace, Courses & Community, and Amazon-style Marketplace. Documentation was consolidated and cleaned up. The latter part of the trajectory demonstrates an aggressive feature expansion phase, driven by user requests to achieve specific endpoint and feature counts (200+ endpoints, 500+ features, then 1500 features), emphasizing user-friendliness and integration. The current state reflects a highly feature-rich backend with continuous development aimed at enhancing user experience and adding sophisticated business tools.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution, developed on a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. It re-implements features from a detailed Laravel specification (features, not tech stack). Key functionalities include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, and tiered subscriptions (Free, Pro, Enterprise with per-feature pricing). Authentication supports Google/Email (Apple was skipped) with Stripe integration and payment method saving. A multi-step onboarding wizard guides new workspace setup, defining 6 main goals (Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, and one AI-decided goal), which dictate visible dashboard features. Core tools cover Instagram management (database, lead generation, posting), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM & Email Marketing (ElasticMail), Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, escrow), unified/gamified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace (add, sell, use templates), and AI/Automation Features (content/image generation, SEO, chatbots) with a token ecosystem. An extensive Admin Dashboard is required for controlling plans and pricing. All visible data must be stored in MongoDB and optimized for Flutter web loader/mobile apps. A professional, mobile-first dark theme design is critical, with no hardcoded data and seamless integration for expansion. The user has also explicitly requested reaching 1500+ features, 200+ API endpoints, focusing on user-friendliness, feature integration, subscription management (cancellation/removal), an auto AI blog, live chat support with AI guidance, and a guided onboarding tour.

The application uses a standard full-stack setup within .



- : Core FastAPI entry point. This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. It centralizes all API routes and authentication, and integrates various systems (JWT, Google OAuth, Stripe, AI token consumption, Link Shortener, Onboarding, Instagram Lead Generation, and numerous other features added across Phases 4, 5, and 6, and subsequent expansion phases). The file size is currently 4631 lines, indicating a large number of endpoints (currently 240+ verified).
- : Manages React routing and application context. It was modified to include routes for numerous new and enhanced dashboard pages, reflecting the ongoing feature expansion.
- : UI for URL shortening. Updated to integrate with backend endpoints, moving from mock data to live API calls.
- : Analytics UI. Fixed React Hook rule violations and various icon import errors, ensuring proper rendering and functionality.
- : New frontend page. Created to implement Instagram Database & Lead Generation, alongside its backend endpoints and navigation integration.
- : New frontend page. Created for the comprehensive Template Marketplace. The backend implementation for this was initially attempted but faced issues, though subsequent general backend expansions likely covered it.
- : New frontend page. Created for the Courses & Community System.
- : New frontend page. Created for the Amazon-style E-commerce Marketplace.
- : Defines the main dashboard layout and navigation. Updated to include 'Token Management', 'Workspace Settings', 'Instagram Lead Generation', and other new pages in the sidebar. Also, icon import issues were fixed.
- , , , : These files were reviewed and confirmed to be comprehensive, with ESLint warnings related to global  function usage being fixed.
- Various frontend pages (e.g., , , ): Numerous Heroicons v1 to v2 import fixes were applied across many frontend components to ensure stability and correct icon rendering.
- , : Newly created as part of documentation consolidation and cleanup to provide a structured overview of the platform and its API.
- , , : New comprehensive documentation and reports, consolidating previous scattered information.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a continuous feature expansion drive for the Mewayz platform, aiming to reach and exceed targets of 200+ API endpoints and 500+ features, which later escalated to 1500 total features.

The work primarily involved extensive modifications to the backend, specifically , to add a high volume of new API endpoints and associated business logic. This included:
- Adding advanced features to the backend in general (Phase 4).
- Implementing Valuable Expansions (Phase 5), which likely included features for an Advanced Analytics Suite and Business Management Suite.
- Incorporating Additional Valuable Features (Phase 6) and subsequent Expansion Phase 2 focusing on innovative features.
- A final push to add missing/critical endpoints/features to further boost the endpoint count after the user questioned the feature-to-endpoint ratio. The AI engineer clarified that one endpoint often supports multiple features, explaining the disparity.

The engineer successfully performed multiple edits to , followed by backend: stopped
backend: started to apply changes. Comprehensive backend tests were run after each major expansion phase, reporting high success rates (92.0%, then 95.5%, and subsequent confirmations of exceeding endpoint targets).

The last recorded action involved adding more critical endpoints to  (Chat Message 114, 116) to reach the desired number of endpoints and features, followed by a comprehensive test (Chat Message 117-118). The user then confirmed the current feature count is 800 and requested an increase to 1500, with a focus on user-friendliness, integration, and specific new features (subscription management, AI blog, support role, guided onboarding). The AI engineer acknowledged this new direction.
