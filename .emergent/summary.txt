The previous AI engineer successfully established the Mewayz application, resolving initial environment and loading issues across Laravel and Flutter. A primary focus was configuring Laravel Sanctum for API communication and making the Laravel landing page the default route. Subsequently, the engineer embarked on implementing PWA features in Flutter, which exposed persistent Flutter loading and routing complexities, despite backend PWA and OAuth/2FA integrations being successful. The process involved iterative debugging, including consulting a  to identify a testing error regarding port usage. However, frontend PWA features and newly generated HTML pages for login/dashboard were not yet correctly served. The trajectory concluded with the user explicitly requesting comprehensive documentation, pivoting the immediate task from feature implementation to codebase understanding and summary.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native, all-in-one business platform. It consolidates social media management, digital commerce, education, CRM, and marketing automation. The architecture requires a Laravel 10+ backend with MySQL 8.0+ (API-first via RESTful Laravel Sanctum) and Flutter 3.x for mobile/desktop applications. Key non-functional requirements include high performance (<200ms API, <3s page loads, 10,000+ concurrent users, 99.9% uptime) and stringent security (AES-256, TLS 1.3, SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, RBAC, audit logging). Core features include PWA architecture (app shell, service worker, push notifications), a professional authentication system (OAuth 2.0, SSO, 2FA, biometrics), and a multi-step workspace setup wizard. Future enhancements span an Instagram Intelligence Engine, multi-platform social media, Link in Bio, Courses, Marketplace, CRM, Website Builder, Booking, and AI-powered analytics. The user explicitly requested more in depth features, a completely working Flutter app for mobile, a full professional feeling + look, full testing fix, and the Laravel landing page as the main domain's entry point.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement all advanced features detailed in the new comprehensive Mewayz Platform Specification (e.g., full PWA features, advanced OAuth/2FA frontend, Instagram Intelligence Engine, multi-vendor marketplace, comprehensive CRM, escrow system, template marketplace, AI-powered analytics, etc.).
- Integrate 3rd party APIs based on generated playbooks (Instagram, Twitter/X, 2FA TOTP).
- Address any further issues or improvements identified during the detailed review as per the new specification.
- Await user prioritization for the next set of features from the new specification.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on Phase 1: Core Platform Enhancement, focusing heavily on PWA implementation and an Enhanced Authentication System (OAuth 2.0 and 2FA).

**PWA Implementation:**
*   New service worker (), offline page (), and Flutter services (, , ) were created.
*    and  (Flutter web) were updated for PWA provider and service worker registration.
*   The Laravel landing page () was updated to include PWA service worker registration logic.
*   Initial attempts to serve the Flutter app via  route using  in the public directory and Laravel routes led to 404 errors, indicating persistent routing/serving challenges for the Flutter build.
*   Further attempts to create PWA shortcuts (e.g., , ) as directories also failed until they were renamed to have  extensions.

**Enhanced Authentication System (OAuth 2.0 and 2FA):**
*   Google OAuth credentials were provided by the user and configured in the  file and .
*   A new migration () was created to add , , ,  to the  table.
*   The  model was updated to support these new fields.
*   New controllers  and  were created to handle the respective logic.
*   The existing  was updated to integrate 2FA methods.
*   New API and web routes were added for OAuth callbacks and 2FA endpoints.
*   Backend testing confirmed the OAuth (Google and Apple redirects) and 2FA (setup, verification, recovery) functionality is working perfectly.

**Current State & Nuances:**
*   The Laravel landing page () is functioning and has PWA registration enabled.
*   The backend's PWA, OAuth, and 2FA functionalities are confirmed working.
*   The Flutter application's accessibility and its integration with the newly implemented PWA features on the frontend ( or  and other public HTML files) are still problematic, leading to blank screens or 404s. The static file server seems to have issues serving files without  extensions, and there's a disconnect between the Laravel routes and the public directory serving.
*   Newly created HTML files for login, register, and dashboard (, , ) exist but are not yet fully integrated into a functional frontend flow or properly recognized by the user due to the overall project complexity.
*   The immediate task pivoted from debugging frontend PWA/routing issues to generating comprehensive project documentation, as explicitly requested by the user who felt the testing agent says i dont have so many things... i know i have, but i have multiple projects and instances within this project. i need u to make a full documentation and readme to easily understand the full massive project so u need to dig and good.
