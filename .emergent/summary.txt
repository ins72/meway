The previous AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates a systematic approach to evolving the Mewayz v2 application from an MVP state to a production-ready platform. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the existing backend, resolving critical issues like  serialization and JWT authentication, and converting the HTML landing page to a responsive React component. Subsequently, the work shifted towards expanding core business functionalities, particularly monetization and administrative systems. This involved the iterative creation of new API endpoints and corresponding service layers (e.g., vendor/customer referrals, template marketplace revenue, workspace subscriptions, usage tracking, enterprise revenue, AI token purchasing, launch pricing, and admin pricing). The engineer consistently integrated these new features, updated , and rigorously tested the backend, striving for 100% success rates. Documentation was maintained through various markdown files, reflecting the evolving feature set and production readiness status, indicating a continuous feedback loop and agile development cycle.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is designed as a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI capabilities, serving as an all-in-one business management solution. Core functionalities include a multi-workspace system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user invitations, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and a post-registration setup wizard for essential business tools. The platform is intended to cover social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. Additionally, an AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are critical components. All data is to be persistently stored in MongoDB, ensuring full CRUD operations with real data, optimized for mobile, and offering a native-app-like user experience. The existing FastAPI/React application has established comprehensive backend functionality across 13 major systems with 100% test success, and recent efforts have integrated visual builders, PWA features, native mobile app support, and refined a React landing page for production.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to confirm and implement administrative functionality for pricing plans. The user asked to confirm if an admin can change pricing, limits/features, and disable/enable plans. Upon reviewing the backend codebase, the AI engineer identified that this critical Admin Pricing Management functionality was missing. As a direct response, the engineer proceeded to create the necessary backend files:  for API endpoints and  for the corresponding business logic. The current state is that these two files have just been successfully created, and the AI engineer is about to add the new  API router to  and then continue with implementing the remaining gaps to achieve 100% completion.
