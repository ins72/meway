The AI engineer's work on the Mewayz platform progressed through several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the Laravel environment, resolving PHP/MariaDB dependencies, fixing Stripe integration, and rebranding from ZEPH to Mewayz. This was followed by a major frontend redesign to a modern dark theme, involving extensive SASS and Blade template modifications. A significant phase involved systematically renaming console to dashboard across directories, routes, and views, confirming changes with backend testing. Most recently, all Python/FastAPI components, including Stripe integration, were successfully migrated to a pure Laravel PHP solution. The final actions involved a complete architectural reorganization, moving all backend content to , and comprehensive testing of both frontend and backend, revealing some remaining issues, particularly with inconsistent console to dashboard changes.

The Mewayz platform is envisioned as a comprehensive Laravel-based business solution. The initial challenge involved stabilizing the application after a Flutter frontend removal, which necessitated fixing core functionalities, asset compilation, and API endpoints. The broader product vision encompasses a 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard with dynamic pricing, Instagram Management (accounts, scheduling, analytics, hashtags), AI-powered community features, an Admin dashboard, a public landing page, and an ElasticMail-driven partnership system. Future plans include creator mediakit, wallet, booking, invoice/financial management, and team collaboration. The immediate objectives were achieving consistent Mewayz branding, resolving all bugs (especially frontend authentication), and performing a complete frontend redesign to a modern dark theme. A key imperative was ensuring *all* existing and planned features are professionally presented and fully functional through the new dashboard, including interactive components like drag-and-drop link-in-bio, booking, and AI features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a comprehensive architectural reorganization and testing phase. This involved:
1.  **Full Laravel Instance:** The project was transformed into a single Laravel instance by moving all contents from  directly to . The  directory was then removed.
2.  **Python/FastAPI Removal:** All Python scripts (e.g., , test files) and FastAPI references were removed from the codebase and documentation. The Stripe integration was fully migrated to a new Laravel  using the official Stripe PHP SDK, and the  was updated to utilize this service.
3.  **Professional Project Structure:** The project structure was professionally organized with a new ,  file,  folder updates, and a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow ().
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:** The AI engineer initiated and received results from extensive backend and frontend testing.
    *   **Backend Testing:** Confirmed 100% architectural reorganization, correct file structure, 161+ API routes, Stripe integration, authentication, and dashboard functionality. Identified minor API issues (security, error handling, some CRUD) as needing fixes.
    *   **Frontend Testing:** Confirmed 100% functional authentication flow with redirect, fully operational dashboard access, navigation, responsive design, and professional UX. It also successfully identified and fixed critical issues, including a missing 'console-index' route, PHP syntax errors, comprehensive console routes (now dashboard), and Vite manifest issues. The missing  component was also addressed.
The very last action taken by the AI engineer was, following the user's explicit instruction to completly fix all make sure u keep in mind that we changed console to dashboard and it may not be properly changed everywhere, to initiate a search for all remaining console references in the  directory to systematically fix them. The search yielded 1553 matches, indicating that further cleanup is required.
