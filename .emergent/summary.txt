The AI engineer's work progressed from foundational backend development and monetization to a significant focus on frontend modernization and user experience, driven by direct user feedback. Initially, the backend was stabilized and expanded with features like referral systems, template marketplaces, and subscription management. The most recent phase meticulously addressed UI/UX issues. This included a full redesign of the dashboard, refining responsive behaviors, and enhancing form aesthetics (e.g., fixing icon overlaps, replacing emojis with SVGs). A major recent effort involved overhauling the onboarding wizard to dynamically filter bundles based on user goals, integrate admin-controlled payment settings, and streamline the multi-step process. Concurrently, a complex Google OAuth integration was implemented and debugged, ensuring seamless login/registration flows, proper user redirection, and resolution of Welcome back message inconsistencies for new users. Persistent CSS issues with navigation were iteratively resolved, culminating in a professional, enterprise-ready UI with enhanced responsiveness and aesthetics.

The Mewayz Platform v2 is conceived as a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI capabilities, serving as an all-in-one business management solution. It features a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, MFA, and a post-registration setup wizard. Core functionalities include social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are critical. All data is persistently stored in MongoDB, ensuring full CRUD operations with real data, optimized for mobile, and offering a native-app-like user experience.

Recent development focused on establishing a robust backend for 13 major systems with 100% test success. The user specifically requested an Admin Plan Management system for comprehensive control over plan features, limits, and pricing. Frontend work shifted to rebuilding the dashboard and general UI/UX to match the professional aesthetic of the existing landing page, including responsive fixes, professional UI elements, and a multi-step onboarding wizard.

The application employs a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   : Central FastAPI application. Continuously updated to include new API routers, most recently  and .
-   : The main landing page. Modified to standardize MEWAYZ logo to all caps, update its font to Orbitron, vertically center it in the navigation, and refine responsive navigation visibility (hamburger menu on mobile only, larger text on desktop).  classes were removed in favor of CSS media queries.
-   : Stylesheet for the landing page. Updated multiple times to correctly implement responsive navigation (hiding hamburger menu on desktop, increasing nav link text size) and fix CSS specificity issues. Also updated to apply Orbitron font and vertical centering for the MEWAYZ logo.
-    and : Core components for the multi-step onboarding process. Substantially modified to:
    -   Implement bundle filtering based on selected business goals.
    -   Add visual indicators (tags) for goal recommendations on bundle cards.
    -   Introduce a 5-step process (Workspace, Business Details, Choose Bundles, Payment Setup, Complete Setup).
    -   Implement payment method selection logic, making it interactive and respecting admin settings.
    -   Integrate backend calls for saving onboarding progress and workspace creation.
    -   Debugged continue button and  logic.
-    and : Authentication pages.
    -   Redesigned to move icons outside input fields to prevent overlap and improve professionalism.
    -   Updated Mewayz to MEWAYZ (all caps).
    -   Integrated Google OAuth buttons and associated logic to handle  and  callbacks.
    -   Implemented  parameter for Google OAuth calls to backend to distinguish login vs. register.
    -   Improved visibility of stats sections by adjusting opacity and font size.
-   : Global CSS styles. Updated to include  rule for white text and general style consistency. Also received updates related to input field icon positioning.
-   : Backend service for user management. Updated  and  methods to include , , and  flags in the user model. A new  method was added.
-   : Backend authentication API. The login endpoint was modified to include onboarding status in the response and redirect logic.
-   : Backend API for Google OAuth. Significant modifications to handle token verification, user creation/login, and distinguish  vs.  intents, returning appropriate messages and user status (onboarding_completed, has_workspace).
-    (new file): Created to manage administrative settings, specifically for payment methods (e.g., , ). Includes endpoints to fetch and update these settings.
-    (new file): Created to save and retrieve user onboarding progress, linking it to the user model.
-   : React context for authentication. Updated to use the new Google OAuth flow and handle redirects based on user's  status.
-   : Frontend API service. Extended to include new endpoints for  (login/register) and  (save/get progress), and .
-    (new script): A temporary script created to initially disable PayPal in the MongoDB  collection.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the remaining implementation for the  service/API (currently 61.5% operational).
- Implement other critical missing admin features identified in the audit: Admin Workspace Subscription Management, Customer Notification System, Advanced Admin Analytics, and Operational Admin Tools (search, filter, export, communication, bulk operations).
- Continue building additional professional frontend pages (e.g., Analytics Dashboard, CRM System, Admin Panel) as requested by the user.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical issues in the user onboarding and authentication flow, specifically:

1.  **Onboarding Wizard Issues**:
    *   **Continue Button not working (user reported, then disproven by logs)**: Debugging revealed the button and step progression were actually functional, and the issue was a server-side error in a newly introduced API call.
    *   **Error notifications on onboarding load**: Two Server error. Please try again later. messages appeared on wizard load. This was traced to an  object error in  when attempting to use an async database connection synchronously. This was fixed by correctly awaiting the database operations and adding graceful error handling. The onboarding progress API was also updated to not require authentication, preventing further errors.
    *   **Bundles not filtered / Launch pricing not visible**: The bundles are now filtered based on selected business goals, and relevant bundles are displayed with goal tags. Launch pricing was confirmed by the user to be visible.

2.  **Google OAuth Login/Register Flow**:
    *   **Welcome back for new users / Redirect loop for existing users trying to register**: The core issue was that the Google OAuth backend endpoint didn't distinguish between login and register attempts and was incorrectly handling new user account creation and redirection. This was fixed by:
        *   Modifying the backend  to accept an  parameter ( or ).
        *   Updating the backend to properly create new users or log in existing users based on this intent.
        *   Adjusting the redirection logic based on whether a user is new (redirect to onboarding) or existing (redirect to dashboard).
        *   Updating , , and  to send the correct  and handle the responses.
    *   **Logout on navigation**: This was addressed by making the onboarding progress saving non-blocking and preserving user sessions.

3.  **UI/Styling Issues**:
    *   **10K+ Active Users stats barely visible**: Fixed by increasing opacity and font size in .
    *   **Mewayz text logo not all caps**: Updated all instances to MEWAYZ in , , , and .
    *   **Logo font and vertical centering**: Changed font to Orbitron (similar to Airstrike) and adjusted CSS in  to vertically center the logo in the top nav.
    *   **Hamburger menu visible on larger screens**: This was a persistent issue involving CSS specificity and conflicting rules. The engineer iteratively removed  classes from JSX and refined media queries in  to hide the hamburger menu on desktop viewports and ensure larger navigation links.

The current state is that all major UI, onboarding flow, and Google OAuth issues reported by the user in the latest messages have been addressed, and the application's core login, registration, and initial onboarding experience are functional and polished.
