The previous AI engineer successfully migrated core features of the Mewayz platform from a Laravel-based specification to the existing FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. The process involved centralizing JWT authentication, integrating Google OAuth and Stripe, and implementing extensive social media/email APIs. A major focus was establishing a comprehensive AI token ecosystem with backend logic and corresponding frontend UI. The engineer also addressed critical frontend stability by meticulously fixing numerous icon import errors and React Hook rule violations. Significant progress was made on integrating the Link Shortener, and new comprehensive pages for Instagram Lead Generation, Advanced Template Marketplace, Courses & Community System, and Amazon-style Marketplace were initiated. The work demonstrates an iterative approach, fixing issues and adding features in line with user requirements, while maintaining the specified tech stack. The engineer is now focused on expanding the platform to achieve full feature parity with the extensive product documentation.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution, re-implementing features from a detailed Laravel specification into a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. Key features include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, and tiered subscriptions (Free, Pro, Enterprise with per-feature pricing). Authentication supports Google/Apple/Email with Stripe integration. A multi-step onboarding wizard guides new workspace setup, including 6 main goals (Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, and one AI-decided). Comprehensive tools cover Instagram management, a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM & Email Marketing (ElasticMail), Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, escrow), unified/gamified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and AI/Automation Features (content/image generation, SEO, chatbots) with a token ecosystem (monthly allowance, purchasable). An extensive Admin Dashboard is required. All visible data must be stored in MongoDB (as per current implementation, despite user mentioning MySQL in requirements) and optimized for Flutter web loader/mobile apps. Professional, mobile-first dark theme design is critical. The platform needs seamless integration and expandability, with no hardcoded data.

- : Core FastAPI entry point. Centralizes API routes, authentication, and integrations. Key changes include JWT, Google OAuth, Stripe integration, AI token consumption logic, and new collections for Link Shortener, Onboarding, and Instagram Lead Generation. New backend endpoints for Instagram Lead Generation were added, and an attempt was made to add template marketplace backend.
- : Manages React routing and application context. Modified to include routes for numerous new and enhanced dashboard pages, including , , , , , , , and .
- : Provides UI for URL shortening. It was updated to integrate with the newly confirmed backend endpoints, replacing mock data.
- : Analytics UI. Initially thought to have syntax errors, it was found to be well-implemented, but later had a critical React Hook  conditional call issue fixed by moving the hook definition. Also fixed icon imports (, , ).
- : New frontend page. Created to implement the Instagram Database & Lead Generation feature, including its route and navigation entry.
- : New frontend page. Created to implement the comprehensive Template Marketplace feature.
- : New frontend page. Created to implement the Courses & Community System.
- : New frontend page. Created to implement the Amazon-style E-commerce Marketplace.
- : Defines the main dashboard layout and navigation. Updated to include 'Token Management', 'Workspace Settings', and 'Instagram Lead Generation' in the sidebar navigation. Also fixed an icon import duplication.
- : User invitation interface. Reviewed and confirmed to be comprehensive.
- : Subscription management UI. Reviewed and confirmed to be comprehensive. Also fixed ESLint warning related to  global.
-  and : Components involved in subscription and workspace management. Fixed ESLint warnings related to using the global  function.
- Various frontend pages (e.g., , , , , , ): Numerous icon import issues (, , , , , , , ) were identified and fixed across these files, replacing incorrect Heroicons v1 names with Heroicons v2 equivalents.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Comprehensive confirmation that *all* listed features in the provided documentation are fully functional, integrated, and professionally implemented.
- Complete implementation of the Advanced Template Marketplace backend endpoints.
- Integration of Apple OAuth (explicitly skipped by user).
- Continued removal of any remaining redundant documentation and Laravel remnants, and updating documentation to v3.0.0 and July 20.
- Completion of backend endpoints and frontend integration for newly created Comprehensive Courses System and Amazon-style E-commerce Marketplace.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on completing feature parity and stabilizing the frontend. A series of critical frontend build errors (mostly related to incorrect Heroicons v1 icon names being used in Heroicons v2 context, and React Hook violations) were identified and meticulously fixed across numerous files such as , , , , , , and .

The Link Shortener frontend () was updated to use real API calls, connecting to the already implemented backend endpoints. The workspace invitation and subscription management systems were reviewed and confirmed to be comprehensive.

Following the frontend stabilization, the engineer has resumed adding new major features specified in the product requirements. The most immediate work involved creating new frontend pages for:
-   **Instagram Database & Lead Generation** (). Backend endpoints were also added in , and the route and navigation links were integrated.
-   **Advanced Template Marketplace** (). Backend endpoints were *attempted* to be added to  but the previous sub-agent reported an issue during that attempt (I attempted to help with editing the file /app/backend/main.py but was not able to).
-   **Comprehensive Courses & Community System** ().
-   **Amazon-style E-commerce Marketplace** ().

The last recorded action was the creation of the frontend pages for the Courses and Marketplace systems, with the next logical step being to add their respective routes to  and navigation entries in .
