The previous AI engineer initiated the task by exploring the provided codebase. Initially, the environment setup indicated a React frontend and FastAPI backend. However, the engineer quickly discovered that the actual codebase was a PHP Laravel application, identified by files like , , , and . This was a critical architectural finding.

After confirming the actual tech stack, the AI engineer proceeded to analyze the user's detailed , which outlined comprehensive strategic improvements for the Mewayz platform across four phases. The user explicitly stated that Phase 1 was largely complete and requested the full implementation of Phases 2, 3, and 4.

The AI engineer then systematically began implementing the missing features. This involved first creating new database migration files to support the required data structures, followed by new PHP Eloquent models, API controllers, and route definitions. The work is currently at the stage where the database schema, models, controllers, and routes for the new features have been defined. The immediate next step is to run these migrations and begin testing the newly integrated backend functionalities. The frontend implementation and integration will follow these backend foundational steps.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to transform the Mewayz Platform v2 into an industry-leading solution by implementing a comprehensive set of strategic improvements. The existing platform is a full-stack application. The product requirements are detailed across several key areas:
-   **Business Logic & Monetization**: Enhance pricing (tiered value-based), add revenue optimization (usage-based billing, marketplace commission, premium support), and implement a Business Intelligence Dashboard (revenue analytics, CLV, churn analysis).
-   **User Experience (UX)**: Revamp onboarding (interactive guided tour), enable dashboard personalization (customizable widgets, AI assistant), and improve mobile-first experience (gesture navigation, voice commands, offline mode).
-   **Business Pages & Content**: Add professional landing pages (About Us, Pricing, Features, Case Studies, Blog, Help Center, Legal, Careers, Partners, Press Kit), develop a Content Marketing Hub, and build Trust & Social Proof features (testimonials, case studies, security badges).
-   **Professional Features**: Implement Advanced Team Management (department structure, permission templates, audit logs, time tracking), White-Label Solutions (custom branding, domains), and Enterprise Integration (SSO, Active Directory, CRM, Accounting, Communication tools).
-   **Technical Improvements**: Optimize performance (CDN, database sharding, caching), enhance analytics (predictive, custom reports), and strengthen security (Zero-Trust, compliance monitoring, threat detection).
-   **Design & Branding**: Introduce a Visual Design System (Light/Dark mode, brand colors), Accessibility Improvements (WCAG 2.1, screen reader support), and Responsive Design.
-   **Mobile & PWA Enhancements**: Add Native Mobile Features (Biometric Auth, Push Notifications, Offline Sync) and Mobile-Specific Workflows.
-   **AI & Automation**: Integrate Advanced AI (recommendations, predictive analytics, NLP, computer vision, chatbot) and Machine Learning (user behavior, content optimization).
-   **International & Localization**: Implement Multi-Language Support (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic) and Regional Features (currency, tax compliance).
-   **Analytics & Reporting**: Enhance with Advanced Analytics (forecasting, cohort analysis) and Business Intelligence (data warehouse, real-time analytics).
-   **Security & Compliance**: Implement Enhanced Security (MFA, encryption, key management) and Compliance Frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
-   **Marketing & Growth**: Introduce Growth Marketing Tools (viral sharing, referral program) and Customer Success features.
-   **Innovation & Future Features**: Roadmap for Emerging Technologies (Blockchain, AR/VR, IoT) and Industry-Specific Solutions.

The user explicitly stated that Phase 1 is largely implemented and requested the complete implementation of Phases 2, 3, and 4.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **PHP/Laravel**: The core backend framework, replacing the initially assumed FastAPI.
-   **MySQL**: Inferred relational database used with Laravel Eloquent ORM for data storage.
-   **Supervisor**: Tool for managing and keeping services (like Laravel's web server) running in the background.
-   **Kubernetes Ingress**: Handles routing of external requests to internal service ports (e.g.,  prefix for backend).
-   **Environment Variables**: Strict usage for sensitive configurations like database URLs and backend URLs.
-   **Eloquent ORM**: Laravel's object-relational mapper for database interaction.
-   **Database Migrations**: Laravel's version control for database schema changes.

<code_architecture>
The application's core architecture is based on PHP Laravel framework. The initial environment description provided a React/FastAPI structure, but the actual codebase discovered is a Laravel application.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : This directory now contains new migration files created to define the database schemas for various new features.
    *   : Defines the table for Single Sign-On (SSO) providers.
    *   : Defines tables for hierarchical team organization, roles, and permissions.
    *   : Defines table for custom branding and domain settings.
    *   : Defines table for detailed activity tracking.
    *   : Defines table for automated workflows.
    *   : Defines table for security monitoring and threat detection.
    *   : Defines table for automated compliance checks.
    *   : Defines tables for built-in time management.
    *   : Defines table for team productivity analytics.
    *   : Defines table for supported languages in multi-language support.
    *   : Defines table for storing localized content.
    *   : Defines table for regional tax, legal, and payment settings.
    *   : Defines table for general AI features and settings.
    *   : Defines tables for storing data related to predictive analytics.
    *   : Defines table for managing different AI models.
*   : This directory now includes new Eloquent models corresponding to the new database tables.
    *   , , , , , , , , , , , , , . These files are crucial for interacting with the newly defined database tables and encapsulating business logic related to these features.
*   : New API controllers have been added to handle requests for the new features.
    *   : Manages SSO, Team Management, and White-Label related API endpoints.
    *   : Manages API endpoints for multi-language support and regional features.
    *   : Handles API endpoints related to security compliance and auditing.
    *   : Manages API endpoints for advanced AI features. These controllers expose the functionalities of the new features via RESTful APIs.
*   : The main API routes file has been modified to include the new phase-specific route files.
    *   This file serves as the central entry point for all API routes, including the new ones.
*   , , : These new files were created to organize the API routes for features in Phases 2, 3, and 4 respectively. This modular approach keeps the  file clean and organizes routes by feature sets.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was working on laying the foundational backend infrastructure for Phases 2, 3, and 4 of the Mewayz platform's strategic improvements.

The work completed immediately before this summary request includes:
1.  **Database Migrations**: Created 15 new migration files (e.g.,  to ) within . These migrations define the necessary database tables for features like SSO, team management, white-labeling, audit logs, security events, time tracking, performance metrics, multi-language support, translations, regional settings, AI features, and predictive analytics.
2.  **Eloquent Models**: Created corresponding PHP Eloquent models (e.g., , , , , , , , , etc.) in . These models provide the ORM layer for interacting with the new database tables.
3.  **API Controllers**: Developed new API controllers (e.g., , , , ) to expose API endpoints for the new functionalities.
4.  **API Routes**: Created new route files (, , ) to modularize the API routes for each phase and integrated them into the main  file.

The state of the product is that the backend data structures, business logic containers (models), and API interfaces for a significant portion of the Phase 2-4 features are now defined in code. However, these changes are not yet applied to the database, nor are they exposed or usable by the frontend. The system is in a state where the new backend components are ready for database synchronization and initial testing.
