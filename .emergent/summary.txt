The previous AI engineer initially focused on a quantitative expansion, successfully escalating the Mewayz platform from 800 to over 100,000 features by extensively modifying the backend's . This involved adding numerous API endpoints and associated logic, followed by backend restarts and automated testing, consistently achieving high success rates. However, this aggressive feature addition led to a monolithic codebase with widespread mock data and placeholder functionality, lacking proper modular architecture and real database integration. The user explicitly identified this critical issue, shifting the focus from feature count to architectural integrity and functional implementation. The engineer promptly responded by conducting a comprehensive audit, revealing severe structural deficiencies. The current work involves a complete professional restructuring, creating a modular backend with dedicated , , and  directories. The immediate challenge is resolving conflicting Laravel remnants and relative import errors to establish the new FastAPI architecture, moving towards real data integration and actual functionality.

The Mewayz Platform aims to be an all-in-one, mobile-first PWA business solution using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. It's a re-implementation of a Laravel specification, intended to expand significantly in features. Core functionalities include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, tiered subscriptions (Free, Pro, Enterprise) with Stripe, Google/Email authentication, and a multi-step onboarding wizard. Onboarding defines 6 goals (Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, AI-decided) that dictate dashboard features. Tools encompass Instagram management, drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM & Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified/gamified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and AI/Automation with a token ecosystem. An extensive Admin Dashboard is crucial. Data must be in MongoDB, optimized for mobile. A professional, mobile-first dark theme is required, avoiding hardcoded data and enabling seamless expansion. The user initially requested 10,000+ features, 200+ API endpoints, emphasizing user-friendliness, deep integration, subscription payment issue handling, AI-powered auto blog, live chat support with AI, guided onboarding, globalization, and marketing capabilities. More recently, the focus shifted to fixing placeholder/mock data to use real database interaction, ensuring actual functionality, improving user experience, retention, and conversion, and establishing a professional, maintainable code structure.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the professional restructuring of the backend, migrating functionality from  to the new modular structure (, , ).
- Replace all placeholder text and mock data with real data synced with the MongoDB database.
- Ensure all features perform their supposed functionality instead of being placeholders.
- Clean up any remaining Laravel components or conflicts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had completed a highly quantitative phase, expanding the platform to over 100,000 features by adding extensive code to the monolithic . This was followed by comprehensive backend testing, consistently showing high success rates, although the implementation largely involved mock data and placeholder functionality.

The user then critically observed the prevalence of placeholder text, hard-coded mock data, and lack of real database synchronization, explicitly requesting a fix to use real data and establish a professional structure.

Responding to this, the AI engineer initiated a COMPREHENSIVE PLATFORM AUDIT. Key findings from this audit were:
1.  A massive, monolithic  file (26,296 lines).
2.  An epidemic of mock data, with 227 endpoints returning hardcoded responses.
3.  Limited actual database operations (only 332 queries vs. 227 mock endpoints).
4.  29 explicit mock/placeholder implementations.
5.  Zero modular architecture.

Based on these critical findings, a PROFESSIONAL RESTRUCTURING PLAN was commenced. The work-in-progress involves:
1.  Creating new directories for a modular FastAPI backend:
    *    (for , , , )
    *    (for , , , , )
    *    (for , , , , , , )
2.  Creating a new main entry point .
3.  Backing up the original  to .
4.  Updating  to include routes from the newly created modular API files.

The current state is that during the integration of the new  and the modular routes, the backend failed to start. Logs revealed  and an unexpected , indicating a Laravel conflict. The AI engineer is currently in the process of fixing these import issues and explicitly acknowledged the user's direction to clear/clean/remove laravel.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to completely remove Laravel components and fix all import issues in the new modular backend, then proceed with migrating actual functionality from  to the new , , and  structure with real database interactions.
