The trajectory outlines a multi-turn conversation where the AI engineer was tasked with summarizing an existing codebase and then restructuring it. Initially, there was confusion regarding the primary tech stack, with the environment setup suggesting React/FastAPI/MongoDB, while the codebase revealed a strong Laravel (PHP, Blade, Livewire) presence and a Flutter application. The AI iteratively explored the file system, identifying the actual components. Through repeated user clarifications, the objective evolved: consolidate to Laravel for web backend/frontend and Flutter for mobile native, explicitly remove the React frontend, and eliminate redundant HTML files. The AI successfully created detailed rapport documents and updated general documentation. The current state is that the AI has a clear understanding of the existing, somewhat mixed, architecture and is poised to begin the restructuring and cleanup as per the latest user instructions. The previous AI engineer's work involved extensive file system exploration and documentation generation to accurately map the project.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to maintain and expand the Mewayz Platform, described as a Professional All-in-One Business Solution. The core problem identified is a confusing and potentially duplicated technology stack inherited from previous development. The explicit requirements are:
1.  **Comprehensive Project Understanding**: Generate a detailed rapport of the entire project scope, including backend, frontend, and overall functionality, based on actual file analysis rather than assumptions.
2.  **Tech Stack Consolidation**: Identify and confirm the primary technology stack to ensure no duplicated technologies serve the same goal. The user specifically mandates:
    *   **Laravel (PHP)**: To be the sole backend and primary web frontend (using Blade templates and Livewire). This was identified as the full operational platform for a long time.
    *   **Flutter**: To be exclusively for mobile native application development.
    *   **React**: The existing React frontend must be removed as it's considered a duplicate for web functionality covered by Laravel Blade.
3.  **Project Restructuring & Professionalism**: Merge, change, and remove any files necessary to make the project more structured, professional, and consistent. This includes reviewing and potentially removing standalone HTML files if their functionality is duplicated by Blade templates.
4.  **Documentation**: Update/create comprehensive documentation files including API, Deployment, Architecture, and Installation guides, reflecting the accurate and consolidated tech stack.

The application currently integrates MongoDB for data storage and uses Supervisor for process management. Frontend access to the backend is via  and backend to MongoDB via .

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Laravel (PHP)**: Core backend framework, also handling web frontend via Blade templating and Livewire.
- **Flutter (Dart)**: Framework for mobile native application development.
- **React (JavaScript)**: Existing web frontend framework, slated for removal.
- **FastAPI (Python)**: Initially indicated as a backend but not found, likely a misdirection.
- **MongoDB**: Database for data storage.
- **Supervisor**: Process manager for backend/frontend services.
- **Composer**: PHP dependency manager.
- **Yarn**: JavaScript package manager.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project exhibits a mixed technology stack, primarily Laravel (PHP) with Blade/Livewire for web, Flutter for mobile, and a legacy React frontend.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Sections:**

-   : Contains Laravel API and web controllers (e.g., , , ). This indicates the core PHP backend logic.
-   : Contains Laravel Eloquent models (e.g., , ), defining database schemas and relationships.
-   , : Laravel route definitions for API endpoints and web routes respectively. Crucial for understanding the backend API contract and web page routing.
-   : Houses Laravel Blade templates (e.g., , , various components). This is the primary web frontend.
-   : Contains Livewire components, indicating a significant dynamic frontend functionality built within Laravel.
-   : The entry point for the Flutter mobile application, demonstrating a distinct mobile native codebase.
-   , : These are the main files for the React frontend, which is slated for removal. This indicates a redundant web frontend.
-   : Defines PHP dependencies, confirming Laravel's presence.
-   : Defines Node.js/JavaScript dependencies, primarily for the React frontend.
-   : Supervisor configuration. It incorrectly lists  running  (Python FastAPI) and  running yarn run v1.22.22

-   : Several HTML files (e.g., , , , ) exist. The user has requested to review and potentially remove these as they might duplicate Blade functionality.
-   : Project documentation.
-    (e.g., , ): Various documentation files created/updated by the previous AI engineer summarizing the project and its architecture.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Restructure the project to be more professional and consistent.
-   Remove the React frontend ( directory and related configurations/dependencies).
-   Review and remove redundant HTML files from the  directory that duplicate functionality provided by Laravel Blade templates.
-   Ensure no duplicated tech stacks exist for the same goal (web frontend).

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has completed a comprehensive audit and documentation update of the Mewayz Platform. The current state is that the project is recognized as a Laravel (PHP) application serving both backend APIs and a primary web frontend via Blade templates and Livewire. There is also a distinct Flutter application for mobile native functionality. Crucially, a React frontend () has been identified, which the user explicitly wants removed due to redundancy with the Laravel Blade frontend. The  directory was initially assumed to house a FastAPI backend based on environment setup, but was found to be non-existent or misconfigured, and the actual backend is Laravel PHP. The supervisor configuration reflects this initial misassumption, with the 'backend' service being  due to a non-existent directory. The AI has also created or updated , , , and  files based on its findings. The last action taken was identifying specific HTML files (like ) that might be redundant with existing Blade functionality, in preparation for the requested restructuring and removal of duplicate components. The AI has just acknowledged the next steps to start restructuring by removing redundant components.

Proceed with removing the  directory and its contents, along with related configurations, and then analyze  for redundant HTML files to be removed.
