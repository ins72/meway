The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz platform from an MVP to a near production-ready state. Initial efforts focused heavily on stabilizing the core Laravel/PHP environment, which involved extensive debugging of persistent PHP/MariaDB installation issues and complex foreign key constraint errors and syntax errors within numerous migration files. Following environmental stabilization, core features like workspace setup and real-time WebSocket collaboration were implemented. The project then broadened to address a comprehensive user request for an Ultra-Advanced Gamification System and an Ultra-Comprehensive Admin Dashboard System, both reported as largely functional. The most recent phase involved a production-ready platform transformation, where the engineer systematically audited and replaced mock data in controllers, implemented missing business logic, created new models, controllers, and routes for legal, business, payment, subscription, and affiliate infrastructure, while continuing to battle and fix recurring database migration issues.

The Mewayz Platform v2 aims to be an all-in-one business solution encompassing social media, course creation, e-commerce, and marketing. Key features include a multi-workspace system with role-based access, professional authentication (Google/Apple), a multi-process workspace setup wizard (6 goals, 40 features, team invites), and a 3-tier subscription model. All data must be MySQL-seeded. The platform requires mobile PWA optimization, an extensive admin dashboard, real-time WebSocket collaboration, and advanced document editing tools.

Initial requests emphasized an in-depth audit of existing social media, Link in Bio, payment/subscription, and CRM features, highlighting incomplete implementations. Subsequently, an Ultra-Advanced Gamification System was required, featuring dynamic achievements, XP/progression, streaks, leaderboards, challenges, and rewards. Simultaneously, an Ultra-Comprehensive Admin Dashboard System was mandated for plan, user, pricing, and enterprise management, including API key management, with an explicit demand for full functionality.

Most recently, the user requested a production-ready platform transformation, stressing the removal of mock data, implementation of missing blades/routes/controllers, and ensuring all placeholder code is fully functional and not hardcoded. This includes ensuring correct syncing for subscription plan changes (add/remove/price updates), professional payment flows (saving payment methods, cancellation), easy integrations, comprehensive account removal, and setting up affiliate/referral systems with advanced admin controls.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer's immediate focus was transforming the Mewayz platform into a production-ready state, addressing the user's detailed request. This involved a multi-pronged approach starting with an extensive audit of the codebase for mock data, placeholder code, and missing components.

Significant backend work was done to replace hardcoded mock data with real database queries in , , and , and completing associated TODO items. A major portion of recent effort was dedicated to stabilizing the development environment, repeatedly troubleshooting and fixing PHP, Composer, and MariaDB installation issues, and resolving numerous  and  related to database migrations. This involved manually installing necessary packages, restarting services, fixing syntax errors in old migration files, and creating a set of specific new migrations to ensure essential and new production-ready tables (, , , , etc.) are created correctly.

To meet the production-ready requirements, the engineer created numerous new models for course features, legal/compliance infrastructure (e.g., , , ), and general business features (e.g., , , , ). Corresponding new controllers were developed, including , , , , , , and an . New service classes for subscriptions and payments were also introduced. These new functionalities were integrated by adding new API routes in , ,  and updating .

The latest ongoing task involves resolving persistent database migration issues to ensure all required tables for the newly implemented production-ready features are successfully created. After an attempt to run a comprehensive migration for these tables failed due to foreign key constraints and already existing tables, the engineer's last action was to identify existing tables and create a simplified migration () specifically for the tables that were still missing.
