The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the Mewayz Platform from an MVP to a robust, production-ready application. The initial phase focused on eliminating random/mock data, integrating real external APIs (social media, payments, file storage, email), and professionalizing the core architecture. This involved extensive audits, targeted fixes in services and API files, and comprehensive testing. Key achievements include 100% elimination of random data from business logic, full integration of various third-party APIs (Twitter, TikTok, OpenAI, Stripe, Google OAuth, ElasticMail), robust security (JWT), and a professional admin configuration dashboard. The project then pivoted to implementing advanced features: AI analytics, real-time notifications, and workflow automation. The engineer meticulously created core modules and API endpoints for these, addressed syntax errors, and performed rigorous CRUD and data source verifications. The latest objective is to further fill the gaps to meet a full enterprise specification.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is a mobile-first PWA business solution using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, designed to be an all-in-one, AI-powered ecosystem. It aims to offer extensive functionalities including multi-workspace support, RBAC, user invitations, Stripe/Google/Email authentication, multi-step onboarding, comprehensive social media management (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn), Link in Bio, CRM, Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, Analytics, Course & Community, Template Marketplace, and an AI/Automation suite with a token economy, all accessible via an Admin Dashboard. Technical mandates include exclusive MongoDB usage, mobile optimization, dark theme support, and strict avoidance of hardcoded data. The initial phase migrated from a monolithic Python script to a modular FastAPI/React architecture. The subsequent, now largely completed, phase rigorously transitioned from mock data to real data, establishing a robust, scalable structure, and fully integrating numerous external APIs. The platform is deemed production-ready, and the user has requested further enhancements to meet a comprehensive enterprise specification.

<code_architecture>

- : The central FastAPI application. It has been extensively refined to dynamically import and include APIRouter instances, manage middleware (CORS, Auth), and connect to core infrastructure. Recent changes included updating  to include newly created API modules and ensuring proper middleware.
- : This directory houses core infrastructure.
    - , , : Newly created as part of the Enhanced Features phase to encapsulate advanced AI analytics, real-time notifications, and workflow automation logic, respectively.
    - , , , , : These files contain robust implementations for managing admin-configurable API keys, integrating various external services, managing file storage (Backblaze B2), handling multiple payment processors, and providing professional logging.
- : Contains business logic.
    - : A utility script used to eliminate random data and fix syntax issues across many service files.
    - : Crucial for fetching and populating the database with real external API data, replacing mock data.
    - , , , : These and other service files were examined and had syntax errors (e.g., indentation, misplaced methods, f-string issues) fixed.
- : Contains FastAPI  modules.
    - , , : Newly created API endpoint files to expose the functionalities of their respective core modules. Changes included fixing initial import errors ( to ) and correcting routing conflicts (e.g.,  endpoint in ).
    - , , : Examined for random data; found to use  which is cryptographically secure and appropriate for code generation, despite being flagged by generic random data searches.
- : Updated to include  and other necessary backend dependencies.
- , , , : Utility scripts created during the audit phases to verify the elimination of random data and the functionality of CRUD operations.
- : Script created to integrate provided external API keys into the system.
- , : Scripts created to implement the remaining advanced enterprise features as per the detailed specification.
- : A report generated to detail the analysis of the project against the full specification.

<pending_tasks>
The most recent overarching task is to fill the gaps/missing/not in depth features etc to bring the platform to full enterprise specification compliance. Specific aspects still under active implementation/verification include:
- Implementing comprehensive advanced enterprise features beyond the existing foundational elements.
- Verifying all newly implemented enterprise features against the detailed specification.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with filling the gaps/missing/not in depth features etc to meet the comprehensive Mewayz v2 - Enterprise All-in-One Business Platform specification. This follows a rigorous audit that declared the platform production-ready, confirming excellent CRUD operations (930 total database operations across 153 files), functional elimination of random data (now only secure code generation remains), and full operational status of all core business APIs including newly implemented AI Analytics, Real-time Notifications, and Workflow Automation.

To address the latest request, the engineer has just created and executed  to initiate the process of bringing the platform to full enterprise specification. Following this, the engineer created , indicating that the implementation of these advanced features is an ongoing process. The next immediate step in the trajectory is to continue implementing and verifying these remaining enterprise features.
