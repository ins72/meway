<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully continued the systematic migration of features from a monolithic Python script () to a modular FastAPI and React application. This process, spanning the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Waves, involved identifying high-value features, creating dedicated API () and service () modules for each, integrating them into the central , and rigorously testing with real data. A key aspect was the systematic removal of migrated code from the old file after successful integration. The engineer adeptly handled testing challenges, including authentication requirements and minor endpoint issues, ensuring core functionalities were successfully ported and operational. The structured approach ensured continuous progress in enhancing the Mewayz platform's architecture.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform is a mobile-first PWA business solution, re-engineered using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, aiming for extensive feature expansion. It supports a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, and tiered subscriptions via Stripe. Core functionalities include Google/Email authentication, a multi-step onboarding wizard, Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, CRM, Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, Course & Community System, Template Marketplace, and an AI/Automation suite with a token economy, all managed via an Admin Dashboard. The platform must use MongoDB, be mobile-optimized, support dark theme, and avoid hardcoded data for scalability. Current priorities involve eliminating mock data, ensuring real database interaction, improving UX/retention/conversion, establishing a maintainable code structure, and removing all legacy Laravel remnants. The previous engineer focused on the systematic migration of these features.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (PyMongo), JWT, Authlib (Google OAuth), Stripe.
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Context API, Axios.
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Ingress,  variables, CORS, PWA.
- **Architecture**: Modular Design (API, Services, Core), Dependency Injection, Multi-Workspace, RBAC, Subscription Management, AI Token Economy.

<code_architecture>
The application features a full-stack architecture residing in the  directory.


- : The central entry point for the FastAPI application. It includes  instances from the  directory.
    - **Changes**: Systematically updated to include new modules for Social Media & Email Integration, Advanced Financial Analytics, Enhanced E-commerce (Ninth Wave), Advanced Automation, Advanced AI Suite, Support System (Tenth Wave), Advanced Content Creation Suite, Advanced Customer Experience Suite, and Advanced Social Media Suite (Eleventh Wave). This ensures new features are discoverable and routed correctly.
- : This monolithic file serves as the source for feature migration.
    - **Changes**: Sections for Enhanced E-commerce, Advanced Automation Suite, Advanced AI Suite, and Support System features, along with related collection definitions, have been systematically removed after successful migration. This reduces the file size and eliminates legacy code.
- : New API modules have been created (e.g., , , , , , , , , ). These encapsulate distinct API routes for new features.
- : Corresponding service files (e.g., ,  (re-used), , , , , , , ) have been created to house the business logic for each new API module.
- : Continuously updated to log testing outcomes and migration progress for the Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Waves, detailing successful integrations and any issues encountered (e.g., authentication, user ID field access).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully completed the **Eleventh Wave** of feature migration. This involved:
1.  **Identification of features**: Advanced Content Creation Suite, Advanced Customer Experience Suite, and Advanced Social Media Suite were selected from .
2.  **Creation of API modules**:
    *    (Chat Message 204)
    *    (Chat Message 208)
    *    (Chat Message 215)
3.  **Creation of corresponding service modules**:
    *    (Chat Message 206)
    *    (Chat Message 213)
    *    (Chat Message 217)
4.  **Integration into **: The new API routers for Content Creation, Customer Experience, and Social Media Suites were successfully imported and included in  (Chat Messages 219, 221).
5.  **Testing**: The Eleventh Wave implementation was tested, and the testing was confirmed successful (Chat Message 223).
The work is at the point where the Eleventh Wave features are fully integrated and tested, and the next step is to finalize this wave by updating the  and removing the code from the old monolithic file.
