The previous AI engineer diligently transformed the Mewayz platform from an MVP, tackling numerous environmental and database migration complexities. Initial efforts stabilized the Laravel/PHP/MariaDB stack, plagued by persistent , , and  issues, requiring manual package installations and credential fixes. Following this, the engineer systematically eliminated mock data, implemented missing business logic across various controllers (e.g., , ), and introduced new core features like gamification and enhanced admin controls.

A significant portion of the work involved resolving intricate database migration failures due to foreign key constraints and pre-existing tables, necessitating multiple attempts to migrate specific tables and cleanup efforts. The most recent phase focused on a production-ready transformation, involving the creation of extensive new models, controllers (e.g., for Legal, Business, Payment, Subscription, Account Deletion, Affiliate systems, and an ), and routes. Debugging continued, addressing  (e.g., in ),  (missing controllers like ), and  (service dependencies). The engineer has successfully implemented critical components for the payment, affiliate, and core business infrastructure and has just completed comprehensive backend and frontend testing. The immediate next step, as indicated by the user's latest extensive request, is to build a comprehensive automated installer system.

The Mewayz Platform v2 aims to be an all-in-one business solution with social media, course creation, e-commerce, and marketing features. It requires a multi-workspace system with role-based access, professional authentication (Google/Apple), a multi-process workspace setup wizard, and a 3-tier subscription model, all backed by MySQL-seeded data. Key demands included mobile PWA optimization, an extensive admin dashboard, real-time WebSocket collaboration, and advanced document editing.

Initial work focused on auditing existing features (social media, Link in Bio, payments, CRM) for incomplete implementations. This evolved into requests for an Ultra-Advanced Gamification System (achievements, XP, streaks, leaderboards, challenges, rewards) and an Ultra-Comprehensive Admin Dashboard System (plan, user, pricing, enterprise management, API keys), both mandated as fully functional.

Most recently, the user demanded a production-ready platform transformation, emphasizing mock data removal, implementation of missing blades/routes/controllers, and ensuring all placeholder code is functional and not hardcoded. This includes robust syncing for subscription plan changes, professional on-platform payment flows (saving payment methods, cancellation), easy integrations, comprehensive account removal, and fully functional affiliate/referral systems with advanced admin controls, ensuring the platform functions professionally, user-friendly, and displays up-to-date information. The user also specified a detailed list of essential business needs, comprehensive testing mandates, and an automated installer system.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was deeply involved in transforming the Mewayz platform into a production-ready state, a task that expanded significantly with detailed user mandates. This involved a multi-faceted approach. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the underlying infrastructure, repeatedly debugging and resolving persistent PHP, Composer, and MariaDB installation and connectivity issues (, , ). This also included fixing numerous  and  errors within existing and new database migration files (e.g., , ), often due to foreign key constraints or already existing tables, requiring specific migration runs and manual file organization.

Simultaneously, the engineer replaced hardcoded mock data in , , and  with real database queries, and completed associated TODOs. To fulfill the production-ready requirements, numerous new models and controllers were created, encompassing functionalities for payment management (, ), user account deletion (), a comprehensive affiliate/referral system (, , , ), and an enhanced admin panel (). Furthermore, a new wave of essential business models (, , etc.) and corresponding controllers (, , ) and Blade views (, ) were created based on the latest comprehensive user demands. Critical middleware issues, such as an  error in , were identified and fixed.

Immediately prior to this summary, the engineer had completed comprehensive backend testing, which achieved a 75% success rate, confirming that core systems like BioSite, Escrow, Booking, and Email Marketing functionalities, along with the newly implemented payment and affiliate systems, are largely operational. Following this, frontend testing was executed, identifying critical UI issues. The very last action was preparing to implement the Automated Installer System, which is a major, newly requested feature to streamline platform setup.
