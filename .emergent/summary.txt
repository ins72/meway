The previous AI engineer successfully established a Laravel 11 application, implementing core features like Website Builder, Escrow, Advanced Booking, Financial Management, and AI integration. A critical authentication issue, switching from  to  middleware, was resolved. The Escrow and Advanced Booking systems are fully implemented. The user explicitly shifted the frontend requirement from React to Laravel Blade and emphasized achieving 100% completion with all configurations managed via an admin dashboard. The current task, initiated by the user's explicit instruction, is a comprehensive audit of the entire codebase: all documentation files, every blade file, all routes, and all controllers. The AI engineer is currently in the process of systematically reading through these files to understand the existing implementation and identify gaps, with the immediate task being the thorough review of all blade templates. A known technical issue involves controllers incorrectly using  instead of .

The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution. It consolidates social media management, digital commerce, educational content, CRM, and marketing automation. Key features include a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and feature-based subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise tiers). Authentication will support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, and future biometric options. Core functionalities cover Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, and Analytics, all managed via an extensive Admin Dashboard. The platform must be mobile-optimized (PWA with Flutter web loader), built on Laravel with MySQL (MariaDB), and all data persisted in the database. The user emphasized that all environment variables, API keys, and database configurations should be visually managed through the admin dashboard, aiming for 100% feature completion.

<code_architecture>
The codebase is a Laravel 11 application structured as follows:


-   : Contains API endpoints for core features. , , , , and  are crucial for backend functionality, implementing respective business logic.
-   : This custom middleware was implemented to resolve a critical authentication issue, replacing the default  for secure access to API features.
-   : Laravel Eloquent models like , , , , and  map to database tables, representing data structures for new features.
-   : Defines the database schema. Numerous migrations were added for Escrow, Booking, Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace, along with updates to  and  tables, addressing foreign key consistency.
-   : These Blade files define the frontend UI.  and  are important for the workspace setup wizard and the main dashboard view. The ongoing audit is systematically examining all these views.
-    and : Define application routes.  was modified to include routes for new API controllers using .  handles web-based routes, including the workspace setup wizard.
-   , , : These documents track the progress, findings, and completion status of platform audits.
-   : Used for tracking testing results and communication with testing agents.

<current_work>
The Laravel 11 application is built on a robust backend with MariaDB, featuring established UI styling and basic dashboard views. A major authentication challenge was successfully overcome by switching from  to a  middleware across API routes. The Escrow System and Advanced Booking System are fully implemented and verified on the backend, involving new models, migrations, and foreign key corrections.

The previous AI engineer's most recent focus was addressing critical missing features and auditing the codebase to progress towards 100% completion (previously at 42%). This included establishing backend infrastructure for the Multi-workspace System (setup, features, goals, subscription plans, team invitations), with corresponding migrations and a . Frontend Blade views (, ) and web routes for this system were created, and database issues related to missing  and  columns in the  table were fixed.

Additionally, the Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace features have been scaffolded on the backend, including controllers, models, and migrations, with API routes added. The immediate task, as per explicit user request, is a comprehensive audit of all documentation files, blade files, routes, and controllers. The AI engineer has successfully read , , , and . The AI engineer is currently in the process of systematically reading every blade file in , having read several foundational and dashboard-related views. A known outstanding issue is that backend controllers still incorrectly use  instead of  for authenticated user retrieval.
