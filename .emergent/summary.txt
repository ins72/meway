The previous AI engineer initially misinterpreted the project's tech stack, assuming a React/FastAPI/MongoDB environment. Upon correction, the engineer pivoted to enhancing an existing Laravel-based application with MySQL, Blade, and Livewire. A significant portion of the work involved resolving environmental issues, including installing PHP, Composer, and MariaDB, and fixing  errors. Once the environment was somewhat stable, the engineer proceeded with foundational UI enhancements, such as creating a dashboard layout, an enhanced workspace setup page, and a login page, alongside modifying existing Instagram and main dashboard views. However, a detailed self-audit revealed that only about 15% of the comprehensive feature documentation has been implemented, focusing primarily on basic architecture, authentication, and UI. The engineer's last attempt to implement core CRM features was blocked by a recurring  error, highlighting ongoing environment instability.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution, consolidating social media management, digital commerce, educational content, CRM, and marketing automation. Key requirements include a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and feature-based subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise tiers). Authentication must support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, with future biometric options. Core features encompass Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, and a Marketing Hub, all dynamically visible based on workspace configuration. The platform also requires unified analytics with gamification, a template marketplace, and an extensive admin dashboard. A strong emphasis is placed on mobile optimization as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Flutter web loader and persistent data storage, ideally in Supabase (though currently MySQL).

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer successfully set up the core Laravel 11 application with MariaDB, ran migrations and seeders, and verified basic API functionality. A professional dark theme UI was implemented across initial views, including a new responsive dashboard layout, an enhanced workspace setup wizard (though its full integration with feature selection and subscriptions is pending completion), and a dedicated login page. An Instagram management interface and a basic admin dashboard were also created/modified. The asset pipeline was configured using Vite, and basic PWA features like service worker and manifest were added. However, during the attempt to expand the CRM functionality by creating new migrations and models, the PHP environment became unstable, indicated by recurring php: not found errors, which halted further development. The most recent action was an incomplete attempt to perform a full audit of implemented features, which revealed a ~15% overall completion rate of the comprehensive documentation.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Re-establish a stable PHP/Laravel environment to resolve the php: not found error, which is currently blocking all backend development and accurate auditing.
