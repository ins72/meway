The AI engineer successfully progressed the Mewayz platform from an MVP to a more production-ready state, overcoming initial infrastructure hurdles (PHP/MariaDB/Redis issues,  parsing) and implementing core features like gamification, payments, and an affiliate system. A significant achievement was the development and refinement of a multi-step automated installer at , which required extensive UI/backend work and debugging. Most recently, the user initiated a complete platform UI/styling overhaul. The engineer has diligently recreated numerous core and dashboard Blade templates with a new modern design, including fixing environment issues during this process. The current trajectory shows the completion of dashboard view creation and the commencement of creating additional business and legal pages, with an ongoing mandate to integrate backend functionality for these new views and address broader production readiness.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as an all-in-one business solution encompassing social media management, course creation, e-commerce, and email marketing. Core requirements include a multi-workspace system with role-based access, professional authentication (Google/Apple), a multi-process workspace setup wizard, and a 3-tier subscription model. Mobile PWA optimization, an extensive admin dashboard, real-time WebSocket collaboration, and advanced document editing are also required.

The development trajectory began with auditing existing features for incompleteness. Subsequent mandates included an Ultra-Advanced Gamification System and an Ultra-Comprehensive Admin Dashboard System. The platform was required to achieve production-ready transformation by removing mock data, implementing all placeholder code, ensuring robust subscription syncing, professional on-platform payment flows, comprehensive account removal, and a fully functional affiliate/referral system. A critical, explicit new request was the creation of a comprehensive automated installer system at  for one-click setup. The user further mandated comprehensive full-stack testing with zero issues, and a complete redesign of all UI/styling based on specific light/dark color palettes to ensure a professional aesthetic.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed an extensive round of comprehensive backend and frontend testing, achieving 89.5% backend success. A user mandate then initiated a complete UI/styling overhaul. The engineer successfully removed existing Blade templates and styling, recreating core layouts (, ), the homepage (), main dashboard (), authentication pages (, ), essential business pages (, ), and automated installer views (, ) with the new modern design.

The engineer successfully completed Phase 1: Dashboard Views Creation, creating 22 comprehensive dashboard views (e.g., , , , , , , , , , , GNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)

Following this, the user requested the creation of *all* missing pages (including about us, contact, support, privacy policy, account removal) with full backend functionality, alongside implementing the broader production features. The engineer commenced this by identifying existing business and legal routes/views and then created new business pages (, ), and also created the  directory, preparing to create the legal pages. The work is currently focused on systematically creating these missing pages and their associated backend logic.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue creating the remaining missing legal pages (, , ) and their associated backend logic, as discussed in the most recent messages.
