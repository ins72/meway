The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Laravel 11 application, addressing initial environmental hurdles and establishing foundational UI components. Following a comprehensive audit that revealed a 23.7% completion rate, the user explicitly tasked the engineer with bringing all features to 100%. The engineer systematically implemented backend scaffolding for critical features: Website Builder, Escrow, Advanced Booking, Financial Management, and AI integration. A major middleware authentication issue (from  to ) was identified and successfully resolved across newly added features. Subsequently, the Escrow and Advanced Booking systems were fully implemented and tested, including resolution of several database schema inconsistencies and missing model relationships (e.g., , ). A second, more detailed audit, prompted by the user, updated the platform's overall completion to 42%. Based on high-priority recommendations from this audit, the engineer proceeded to implement the Link Shortener, Referral System, and Template Marketplace, including all necessary controllers, models, and migrations. The work concluded with the identification of a new authentication issue where controllers incorrectly use  instead of .

The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution, consolidating social media management, digital commerce, educational content, CRM, and marketing automation. It features a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and feature-based subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise). Authentication will support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, with future biometric options. Core features include Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, Analytics, and an extensive Admin Dashboard. The platform is designed as a mobile-optimized Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Flutter web loader and persistent data storage, built on Laravel with MySQL/MariaDB. Key user flows involve registration leading to a multi-process workspace setup wizard, team invitations, subscription management, and goal-based feature visibility. All data must be saved to a database (Supabase suggested in documentation, though current backend uses MariaDB) to avoid hardcoding.

<code_architecture>
The codebase is a Laravel application.


- : Critical for database connectivity and general application setup.
- : Defines database schema. Many new migrations were added for Website Builder, Biometric Auth, Escrow, Booking, Workspace Management, Link Shortener, Referral, and Template Marketplace, along with modifications to existing tables (e.g., , ) to add necessary columns (, , ). Foreign key issues were a recurring problem and fixed.
- : Laravel Eloquent models. Numerous new models were created (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) to support new database structures and business logic.
- : API controllers. New controllers like , , , , , , , , , , and  were added to expose new API functionalities.
- : Implicitly modified or used to fix the authentication middleware issue, replacing .
- : Comprehensive dashboard layout.
- : For enhanced workspace setup wizard (initial).
- : New Blade file for the comprehensive 6-step workspace setup wizard frontend.
- : New Blade file for the main dashboard view post-workspace setup.
- : Significantly modified to add routes for newly created API controllers and to update middleware usage.
- : Modified to add new routes for the workspace setup wizard and the main dashboard.
- : Documented the detailed audit of the platform's completion status.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the UI for the Multi-workspace System and its features (workspace creation, switching, settings, team invitations, roles).
- Complete the full integration and UI for the 6-step workspace setup wizard (frontend views are present but need full functionality).
- Implement the Subscription Management System and its UI (pricing tiers, feature limits, branding).
- Address the identified  vs  authentication issue in controllers.
- Develop the drag-and-drop Link in Bio Builder UI.
- Implement the Social Media Content Calendar and its UI.
- Flesh out remaining features for Social Media Management (Instagram API, advanced filtering, multi-platform support), Courses & Community, Marketplace & E-commerce, Financial Management, Analytics & BI, AI & Automation, and mobile PWA optimization to reach 100% completion.

<current_work>
The Laravel 11 application has a robust backend with MariaDB. Basic UI styling and initial dashboard views are in place. The previous major blocking issue, a middleware authentication problem preventing access to advanced features, has been successfully resolved by switching to  middleware across relevant API routes.

Following this fix, the **Escrow System** has been fully implemented and verified. This involved creating  model and its migration, along with successfully migrating all escrow-related tables (, , , ) and resolving foreign key conflicts by ensuring UUID compatibility. All 8 core escrow endpoints are now fully functional.

The **Advanced Booking System** has also reached core functionality. This required creating  and  models and their migrations, resolving similar foreign key issues by aligning ID types, and updating the  and  model to work with existing table structures. Core booking functions like service creation, appointment listing, and creation are confirmed working.

Most recently, the AI engineer focused on critical missing features identified during a comprehensive audit (which showed 42% completion). The backend infrastructure for the **Multi-workspace System** including workspace setup, features, goals, subscription plans, and team invitations has been established, along with relevant migrations and a seeder (). The frontend views (, ) and web routes for this system have been created. Database issues related to missing  and  columns in the  table were identified and fixed with new migrations.

Furthermore, the **Link Shortener**, **Referral System**, and **Template Marketplace** have been scaffolded out on the backend. This includes creating their respective controllers (, , ), models (, , , , , , , ), and all necessary database migrations. Corresponding API routes in  were added.

The immediate current state is that a comprehensive backend test of these newly implemented systems (Link Shortener, Referral, Template Marketplace) has revealed a common authentication failure: controllers are incorrectly using  instead of  to retrieve the authenticated user.
