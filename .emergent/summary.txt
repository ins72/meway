The previous AI engineer successfully established the Mewayz Creator Economy Platform using Laravel, PHP, MariaDB, and Vite. The initial phase focused on resolving a critical  error through custom authentication middleware (, ) and replacing  calls. Frontend asset compilation was fixed by configuring Vite for SASS. The subsequent work involved addressing controller timeouts and creating missing authentication controllers. Upon receiving the project, the current AI engineer (me) was tasked with conducting a comprehensive audit against detailed product documentation, revealing that the application is predominantly Laravel Blade/Folio based, not React as initially described. This audit, culminating in Chat Message 70, confirmed an 88% feature implementation, highlighting specific missing views, biometric authentication, Flutter web integration, and Supabase integration (which currently uses MariaDB). The current state is a well-built, nearly complete platform, requiring minor additions rather than extensive feature development.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Creator Economy Platform aims to be an all-in-one business solution for creators, integrating social media, courses, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. Key features include: full authentication (Email/Password, Google/Apple OAuth, Biometric auth, Email verification, Invitation system); a 6-step Workspace Management Wizard (goals, features, team, subscription, branding, review) with a dynamic dashboard; core features like Instagram Management, Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, and a Marketing Hub; Analytics & Gamification; a Template Marketplace; Stripe Payment & Subscription system; Team & Role Management (RBAC); an Admin Dashboard; Mobile Optimization via PWA and a Flutter web loader; and robust Data Management & Security (Supabase, encryption). The overall architecture is designed for scalability and future AI/ML integration. The immediate objective was to ensure 100% functionality by identifying and implementing any features truly missing from the comprehensive documentation.

The initial description mentioning  and  (FastAPI) seems to be vestigial, as the comprehensive audit confirms the backend is exclusively Laravel/PHP.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Create 9 missing dashboard Blade views**: Specifically, , , , , , , , , and .
-   **Implement Biometric Authentication**: Integrate WebAuthn API for fingerprint/face recognition.
-   **Implement Flutter Web Integration**: Add Flutter web loader and mobile-specific optimizations.
-   **Implement Real-time Features**: Add real-time notifications and live data synchronization (currently uses MariaDB, not Supabase as initially documented).
-   **Fix 6 failing API tests** (mostly validation-related).
-   **Optimize remaining timeout issues** in complex operations.
-   **Set up production AI integrations** with actual API keys.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer completed a detailed feature comparison report (Chat Message 70) by systematically auditing the implemented Mewayz platform against the provided comprehensive Mewayz Platform Documentation (Chat Message 47). This audit aimed to verify every widget, screen, API, controller, and Blade template.

The audit confirmed the tech stack as Laravel 11.x (PHP 8.1+), MariaDB, Blade templates with Laravel Folio (not React), Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and Vite. It also verified that custom Sanctum middleware is successfully handling authentication, bypassing previous  issues.

The core business functionality is largely complete, with a confirmed 88% overall implementation score. Key implemented areas include:
*   **Authentication**: Email/Password, Google/Apple OAuth, Email verification, Invitation system.
*   **Workspace Management**: Complete 6-step setup wizard, dynamic dashboard, role-based access.
*   **Core Features**: Full implementation of Instagram Management, Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, and Marketing Hub.
*   **Analytics & Gamification**: Unified analytics dashboard and comprehensive gamification system.
*   **Template Marketplace**: Fully functional marketplace with user-generated content and selling.
*   **Payment & Subscription**: Stripe integration with feature-based pricing and webhook management.
*   **Team & Role Management**: Team invitations and RBAC.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: System administration and BI features.
*   **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive Web App (PWA) features (manifest.json, service worker, offline functionality, push notifications).
*   **Frontend Views**: 23 out of 32 expected dashboard pages are implemented.

Minor issues identified include 6 failing API tests, some timeout issues, and the need for production AI API keys. The audit specifically highlighted missing features as Biometric Authentication, 9 dashboard views (e.g., , ), Flutter web integration, and the fact that Supabase integration is documented but MariaDB is currently in use, impacting real-time sync. The current state is that the platform is considered production-ready with minor polish remaining.
