The previous AI engineer initiated the Mewayz Platform project by migrating from a problematic Laravel backend to FastAPI, integrating a React frontend. Initial efforts focused on fixing Laravel issues, then pivoting to FastAPI for core authentication and a dark/light theme for the frontend. A significant shift occurred when the user provided an extensive Mewayz v2 specification, demanding massive depth, a multi-workspace system, workspace-based subscriptions, and comprehensive features driven by MySQL. The engineer then focused on implementing these core architectural changes, including re-creating the AI features page, building out the workspace system (backend and frontend), enhancing dashboard buttons with modals, and initiating documentation. The current state is mid-implementation of this new, comprehensive specification, with core workspace functionalities beginning to take shape.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform aims to be a comprehensive all-in-one business solution, initially a Laravel/React app that encountered stability issues. The user mandated a full migration to a FastAPI/React stack for enhanced stability and professional features. Key requirements include: a modern React frontend with strict dark/light themes, a multi-workspace system with workspace-based subscriptions, granular feature access control, and a massive depth re-implementation of all previous features (e.g., Social Media Management, Link in Bio, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, Website Builder, Booking, Financial Management, Escrow, Analytics, AI, Mobile Apps). All data must be persistently stored in MySQL, not hardcoded. The platform must be production-ready, highly scalable, and optimize for mobile-first PWA experience with a detailed multi-step onboarding wizard including goal and feature selection, team member invitations, and a flexible subscription model (Free, Pro, Enterprise) integrated with Stripe. An extensive admin dashboard for platform control and a template marketplace are also crucial.

<code_architecture>
The application's root  contains the React frontend and now primarily the FastAPI backend.



**Key Files and Their Importance:**
-   : The core FastAPI backend entry point. Continuously updated to integrate newly created modules for comprehensive features and the workspace system.
-    (e.g., , , , ): New Python modules encapsulating various backend features and the foundational multi-workspace logic, contributing to the massive depth requirement.
-   : Manages React routing. Updated to include new dashboard pages, particularly admin routes, and to correctly integrate the re-created .
-   : Manages user authentication state. Modified to support and store the  for the multi-workspace system.
-   : Defines the common dashboard layout. Updated to integrate the  component for workspace switching and include navigation links for the new admin section.
-   : This page was re-created from scratch to address explicit user feedback, providing a significantly improved and more professional AI features experience.
-   : A newly created page for administrative controls, essential for managing platform-wide settings, plans, and users.
-    (e.g., , , , ): Existing dashboard pages were heavily modified to make previously non-functional buttons interactive by integrating new modal components and adding core logic, enhancing overall usability.
-    (e.g., , , ): A new directory of modular components created to provide dynamic forms and displays for various interactive actions across the dashboard pages.
-   : A new frontend component enabling users to seamlessly switch and select different workspaces, a core part of the multi-workspace architecture.
-   : A new documentation file was created to summarize the project, installation, and API, addressing the user's explicit request for updated and relevant documentation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into a major refactoring and feature enhancement effort, driven by the user's detailed Mewayz v2 - Complete Platform Specification. The focus was on building foundational elements for this new comprehensive vision:

1.  **AI Features Page Overhaul**: Responding directly to user feedback, the  was completely re-written to offer a more professional and functional user experience.
2.  **Multi-Workspace System Foundation**:
    *   **Backend**:  was created to handle workspace-related logic, and  was updated to integrate this new system.
    *   **Frontend**: The  was modified to manage a  state, crucial for tracking the user's active workspace. A new  component was developed and integrated into  to enable workspace selection and switching within the UI.
3.  **Enhanced Button Functionality & Modals**: Numerous dashboard pages, including , , , and , received significant updates. Previously non-functional buttons were made interactive by integrating newly created modal components (e.g., , , , , ). This provided real, interactive features rather than placeholders.
4.  **Admin Section Initialization**: A new  page was created, and its routes were added to . The  was updated to include navigation for this admin section.
5.  **Initial Documentation**: A  file was created in a new  directory to outline the project, installation, and API, fulfilling a user request for updated documentation.

Backend testing after these changes showed a 76.9% success rate, indicating that the core multi-workspace and enhanced AI features are beginning to function correctly within the FastAPI backend. The frontend is now prepared for further integration and testing of these new systems.
