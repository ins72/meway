The previous AI engineer initiated a Laravel 11 application, primarily focusing on foundational setup and UI. They encountered significant environmental hurdles, specifically  and MariaDB connectivity issues, which were systematically resolved. A comprehensive audit was conducted, revealing a 23.7% completion against the extensive product specification. The user explicitly mandated bringing all 19 functional sections to 100% completion. Subsequently, the engineer began implementing critical missing features, starting with the Website Builder, and progressing to Escrow, advanced Booking, Financial Management, and AI integration. New controllers, models, migrations, and views were added. The current state reflects substantial progress in backend feature scaffolding, but a middleware authentication issue was identified during the latest backend testing, halting further functional verification.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz platform aims to be an enterprise-grade, cloud-native all-in-one business solution. It consolidates social media management, digital commerce, educational content, CRM, and marketing automation. Key requirements include a multi-workspace system with a 6-step setup wizard, role-based access, and feature-based subscriptions (Free, Professional, Enterprise). Authentication must support email/password, Google/Apple OAuth, with future biometric options. Core features encompass Instagram management, Link in Bio builder, Course creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub, Website Builder, Booking, Template Marketplace, Escrow, Financial Management, Analytics, and an extensive Admin Dashboard. The platform emphasizes mobile optimization as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a Flutter web loader and persistent data storage, built on Laravel with MySQL/MariaDB.

<current_work>
The core Laravel 11 application is set up with MariaDB. Basic migrations and seeders have been run, and fundamental API functionality was previously verified. A professional dark theme UI has been applied to initial views, including a new responsive dashboard layout, an enhanced workspace setup wizard (pending full feature integration), and a dedicated login page. Instagram management and a basic admin dashboard were also implemented. The asset pipeline uses Vite, and basic PWA features are present.

During the previous development cycle, the PHP environment experienced instability (php: not found errors), and MariaDB connection issues, which have since been resolved through reinstallation of PHP, MariaDB, and correction of database credentials in  file, followed by successful migration runs.

A comprehensive audit was performed, establishing the platform's overall completion at 23.7%. Following user instruction to bring ALL features to 100% completion, the AI engineer has systematically added several critical components:
- **Website Builder**: New controllers (), models (, , ), and migrations were created.
- **Dashboard Views**: Missing dashboard views (e.g., , , , , , , , , GNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu)
These shell commands are defined internally.  Type `help' to see this list.
Type `help name' to find out more about the function `name'.
Use `info bash' to find out more about the shell in general.
Use `man -k' or `info' to find out more about commands not in this list.

- **Support/Legal Pages**: , , and  were created.
- **Advanced Features**: Controllers and migrations for Biometric Authentication (, ) and Real-Time features () were introduced.
- **Core Business Feature Expansion**: Escrow (, , , ), Advanced Booking (, , ), Advanced Financial Management (), and Enhanced AI features () were added with corresponding controllers, models, and migrations.
- **Routing**:  was updated to include routes for all new controllers.

The most recent action was a comprehensive backend test that identified a middleware authentication issue, preventing the newly implemented advanced features from being fully functional or accessible.
