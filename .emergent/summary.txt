The AI engineer's work has evolved significantly, from initial UI/UX refinements and onboarding wizard enhancements to deep dives into authentication, payment integration, and critical deployment fixes. Initially, a major effort was spent on stabilizing Google OAuth and fixing an undefined token issue, leading to a robust authentication flow. Subsequently, a comprehensive Stripe integration was implemented, addressing both frontend (Elements, forms) and backend (checkout sessions, payment intents) aspects, including multiple rounds of debugging for 400 errors and ensuring live key functionality. The most recent phase was dominated by persistent deployment failures, shifting from frontend build issues (missing dependencies, syntax errors, import mismatches) to backend runtime problems, specifically addressing the  configuration for MongoDB Atlas and enhancing backend resilience for production environments. The overall trajectory showcases iterative debugging and a thorough approach to solving complex full-stack challenges.

The Mewayz Platform v2 is envisioned as a comprehensive, mobile-first PWA with AI capabilities, functioning as an all-in-one business management solution. Key features include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, MFA, and a post-registration setup wizard. Core functionalities encompass social media management (Twitter/X, TikTok), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, CRM, email marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management, unified Analytics, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace. An AI/Automation suite, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also critical. All data is persistently stored in MongoDB, ensuring full CRUD operations, optimized for mobile, and offering a native-app-like user experience.

Recent development focused on establishing a robust backend for 13 major systems. The user specifically requested an Admin Plan Management system. Frontend work involved rebuilding the dashboard and general UI/UX to match a professional aesthetic, including responsive fixes and a multi-step onboarding wizard. Recent work involved resolving user authentication issues (logout/redirect), integrating real Stripe payment processing into the onboarding wizard, and fixing persistent deployment failures preventing the application from going live to production with MongoDB Atlas.

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (PyMongo, AsyncIOMotor), JWT for authentication, Stripe API.
- **Frontend**: React.js, React Router, CSS (for responsive UI), Google OAuth, Stripe.js, .
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes Ingress, Supervisor, Environment Variables (for sensitive keys and URLs).
- **Architecture**: Modular services (user, Stripe, etc.), API routing, Context API (React).

The application utilizes a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend, following a clear separation of concerns.



**Key Files and Recent Changes:**
-   : Central FastAPI app. Recently updated to include  router and  router. Also modified for more robust lifespan event handling and a resilient  endpoint for production deployment, and simplified catch-all route.
-   : Updated to store LIVE Stripe API keys (, ) and . The  was explicitly checked for production deployment.
-   : Modified to fetch  strictly from environment variables using  for production compatibility with MongoDB Atlas, without local fallbacks. Includes error handling for connection.
-   : Enhanced to correctly fetch Stripe API keys from environment variables and to implement  and  functions for subscription and payment intent handling.
-    (NEW): Created to manage Stripe customer objects (creation, update).
-    (NEW): Created to handle incoming Stripe webhook events (e.g., ).
-   : Expanded with endpoints for creating checkout sessions and confirming payments.
-    (NEW): Created to house new Stripe-related API endpoints including webhook handler ().
-   : Updated to store  with the live publishable key.
-   : Main React application. Significant changes include:
    -   Importing , .

<pending_tasks>
- User is yet to provide the Stripe Webhook Signing Secret () from the Stripe dashboard, which is necessary to fully enable backend webhook processing for subscription management, payment failure handling, and automated workspace creation post-payment.
- Implement comprehensive payment management beyond basic setup: saving payment methods to user accounts, handling payment failures professionally (retry, email, visible features disablement), and redirecting to the created workspace dashboard.
- Complete the remaining implementation for the  service/API (currently 61.5% operational).
- Implement other critical missing admin features identified in the audit: Admin Workspace Subscription Management, Customer Notification System, Advanced Admin Analytics, and Operational Admin Tools.
- Continue building additional professional frontend pages (e.g., Analytics Dashboard, CRM System, Admin Panel).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing critical **deployment failures** of the Mewayz application. The primary issue shifted from frontend compilation errors to **backend runtime failures (503 status codes)** during health checks in the Kubernetes environment, despite successful frontend builds and MongoDB data migration to Atlas.

The engineer's focus was on diagnosing why the backend service wasn't starting correctly in the production environment.
1.  **MongoDB Connection Issue**: The root cause for the backend runtime failure was identified: the  in the  file was still set to a  address. In the deployment environment, the MongoDB connection needs to point to the dedicated Atlas instance, whose connection string is provided as an environment variable by the deployment system. The backend code was not correctly prioritizing the environment variable over the  file's  entry, or was not robust enough to handle the production .
    *   **Fix**: Modified  to ensure  is *strictly* fetched from  for robust production compatibility, preventing fallback to development-specific hardcoded values.
    *   **Impact**: This ensures the backend will attempt to connect to the correct MongoDB Atlas instance in production.
2.  **Backend Resilience**: To improve deployment stability and debugging, the engineer also focused on making the backend more resilient.
    *   **Fix**: Enhanced lifespan event handling in  to provide better error logging during startup/shutdown and ensure graceful database connection management.
    *   **Fix**: Updated the  endpoint in  to function even if the database is temporarily unavailable, allowing Kubernetes health checks to pass and provide a clearer picture of service status.
    *   **Current Action**: The engineer was in the process of adding a catch-all route handler for further debugging.

This work directly addresses the user's report of failed deployments and the subsequent 503 errors. The frontend build is now successful, and the core backend startup issues related to database connectivity for Atlas are being resolved to enable successful deployment.
