The AI engineer's primary objective was to transition the Mewayz v2 platform from MVP to production-readiness, focusing on complete API implementation, data persistence, and eliminating mock data. The trajectory reveals an iterative process plagued by backend startup failures, syntax errors, and persistent router registration issues, preventing many endpoints from loading. Despite multiple comprehensive audit and fix attempts, the system experienced regressions, notably with CRUD operations and mock data resurfacing. The last major effort involved creating bulletproof services/APIs and successfully resolving startup issues, leading to 863 discovered endpoints. However, the final test encountered an authentication barrier, blocking full verification. The user has now provided extensive new documentation and reiterated the need for full CRUD, real data, and addressing duplicates, alongside a new requirement for MySQL (despite MongoDB being current).

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz Platform v2 is a mobile-first PWA integrating over 15 AI-powered business tools. Core features include a multi-workspace system with RBAC, user invitations, multi-factor authentication, and a post-registration setup wizard (6 main goals: Instagram, Link in Bio, Courses, E-commerce, CRM, and one more chosen by the system). Key functionalities encompass social media management (Instagram API, advanced filtering, auto-detection, posting/scheduling), a drag-and-drop Link in Bio builder, full CRM/Email Marketing, Website Builder, Booking System, Financial Management (invoicing, payments, escrow), unified Analytics with gamification, a Skool-like Course & Community platform, and a Template Marketplace (users can add/sell/use templates). An AI/Automation suite with a token economy, extensive Admin Dashboard, and a referral system are also required. All data *must be persistently stored in MySQL* (previously MongoDB), strictly avoiding hardcoded/mock data, ensuring full CRUD across all components. The platform mandates mobile optimization (Flutter web loader), dark theme, seamless integration for expansion, and a native-app like user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep in an iterative cycle of fixing severe backend regressions. The user had demanded a fix ALL approach to achieve 100% working with real data and full CRUD operations.

The AI engineer implemented an  (Chat Message 256), claiming to create 123 bulletproof services and APIs. This script caused new Python syntax errors ( keyword misuse,  for database functions), which the AI engineer subsequently fixed. After these fixes, the backend successfully loaded and ran (Chat Message 274, 278).

A final comprehensive test (Chat Message 280) reported significant progress: **863 endpoints discovered** across 124 service categories with 123 bulletproof services. It claimed the system was working perfectly with proper authentication and real database operations. However, a critical caveat was noted: The testing is being blocked by the authentication barrier. This implies that while the server starts and modules load, the full functional testing of all endpoints is incomplete due to an authentication challenge from the testing agent itself.

The user then provided extensive new documentation (Chat Message 285) detailing all platform features, PWA requirements, design systems, and backend/frontend architecture, while reiterating the need for full CRUD, no mock data, and addressing duplicates, but also introduced a new requirement for  instead of the current . The AI engineer's last action was to commit to analyzing this documentation to provide an assessment.
